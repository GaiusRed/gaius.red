## What is a Break|Point Guide

A Break|Point Guide is centered around the idea that ARPG characters should race to endgame, stopping only on specific breakpoints where there are significant upgrades available. That means running thru the story maps and stopping only to clear high density packs, whether you're playing Path of Exile, Last Epoch or Diablo.

## Eldertuin The Fortress

[Eldertuin The Fortress](/eldertuin-the-fortress/) is a Path of Exile build that is centered on taking advantage of <poe-item as-text reference="Headhunter" icon-inside></poe-item> buffs. It has decent Armour, maximum Block and high Attack Speed to apply multiple Impales &amp; Bleeds via <poe-item as-text reference="Shield Crush" label-text="Shield Crush" icon-inside></poe-item>. In adddition, the build uses <poe-item as-text reference="Inspired Learning" icon-inside></poe-item> while levelling, mapping and saving currency for an actual Headhunter, and sacrifices some "on paper" DPS in order to ensure that every stolen buff will be beneficial.
