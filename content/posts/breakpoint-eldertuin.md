## What is a Break|Point Guide

A Break|Point Guide is centered around the idea that ARPG characters should race to endgame, stopping only on specific breakpoints where there are significant upgrades available. That means running thru the story maps and stopping only to clear high density packs, whether you're playing Path of Exile, Last Epoch or Diablo.

## Eldertuin The Fortress

[Eldertuin The Fortress](/eldertuin-the-fortress/) is a Path of Exile build that is centered on taking advantage of <poe-item as-text reference="Headhunter" icon-inside></poe-item> buffs. It has decent Armour, maximum Block and high Attack Speed to apply multiple Impales &amp; Bleeds via <poe-item as-text reference="Anomalous Shield Crush" label-text="Shield Crush" icon-inside></poe-item>. In adddition, the build uses <poe-item as-text reference="Inspired Learning" icon-inside></poe-item> while levelling, mapping and saving currency for an actual Headhunter, and sacrifices some "on paper" DPS in order to ensure that every stolen buff will be beneficial.

---
## Preperation

Eldertuin The Fortress starts as a Duelist before ascending to a Gladiator. This guide is split into two: <strong style="color:#00B0FF">Initial Runthru</strong> (also known as a League Starter in Path of Exile) and <strong style="color:#651FFF">Invested Runthru</strong> (where you already have some currency at the beginning). Note that this build was made on Softcore Trade League, during 3.15 Expedition League. It is not Solo Self Found viable due to the uniques required, but may be Hardcore viable (untested).

{{< admonition example "Invested Runthru: Levelling Gear" >}}
If you have some starting currency, here are some generic levelling items to help you during the first five (or so) acts. Don't forget to swap them out afterwards, or you will feel like your character is squishy.

<poe-item as-icon reference="Goldrim" icon-size="auto" show-sockets-in-showcase></poe-item>
<poe-item as-icon reference="Tabula Rasa" icon-size="auto" show-sockets-in-showcase></poe-item>
<poe-item as-icon reference="Wanderlust" icon-size="auto" show-sockets-in-showcase></poe-item>
<poe-item as-icon reference="Seven-League Step" icon-size="auto" show-sockets-in-showcase></poe-item>
<poe-item as-icon reference="Araku Tiki" icon-size="auto" show-sockets-in-showcase></poe-item>
<poe-item as-icon reference="Perandus Signet" icon-size="auto" show-sockets-in-showcase></poe-item>
{{</ admonition >}}

As mentioned above, this guide is built around your character only stopping during the breakpoints. In between those points, you should race towards the next quest/map exit/boss kill as fast as you can, only stopping if there's enough monster density around you that the experience gain is worth it.

## Run until the next Break|Point!

Don't forget to loot Wisdom and Portal Scrolls during the early acts!

### The Twilight Strand

After spawning at The Twilight Strand, get your Rusted Sword, stick the <poe-item as-text reference="Double Strike" icon-inside></poe-item> gem and <poe-item as-text reference="Chance to Bleed Support" icon-inside></poe-item> gem in it and bleed Hillock to death. At Lioneye's Watch get the Shield with the highest Armour from the Equipment vendor and <poe-item as-text reference="Shield Crush" icon-inside></poe-item> from the Gem vendor. Link Shield Crush with your Chance to Bleed Support.

{{< admonition example "Invested Runthru: Shopping List" >}}
Get the following gems from Trade if you can:

- 20+% Quality; Level One <poe-item as-text reference="Qual Shield Crush" icon-inside></poe-item>

Note that you can reset the level of non-corrupted gems back to level 1 by vendoring it along with an Orb of Regret. It will keep it's alternate form and quality value.
{{</ admonition >}}

{{< admonition abstract "Initial Runthru: Skip Everything But These..." >}}
- Go thru The Coast until you activate the waypoint
- Enter The Tidal Island, kill Hailrake, get the Medicine Chest **(Quicksilver Flask @ Breakpoint)**
- Go back to The Coast then enter The Mud Flats
- Get the three glyphs, open The Submerged Passage and activate the waypoint
- Look for The Flooded Depths, kill the Dweller of the Deep **(Skill Book @ Breakpoint)**
- Portal back to Lioneye's Reach
{{</ admonition >}}

### Level 6 at The Flooded Depths

Get your quest rewards at Lioneye's Reach. Allocate your skill points, starting from Attack Speed towards the <poe-passive as-text reference="Art of the Gladiator" icon-outside style="display:inline-block"></poe-passive> notable. Buy a Sapphire Ring to help against Merveil later, and the following skill gems: <poe-item as-text reference="Dash" icon-inside></poe-item>, <poe-item as-text reference="Ancestral Protector" icon-inside></poe-item>, <poe-item as-text reference="Blood and Sand" icon-inside></poe-item>, <poe-item as-text reference="War Banner" icon-inside></poe-item>, <poe-item as-text reference="Steelskin" icon-inside></poe-item>, <poe-item as-text reference="Reckoning" icon-inside></poe-item> and <poe-item as-text reference="Onslaught Support" icon-inside></poe-item>.

{{< figure src="/images/eldertuin-lvl-06.png" >}}

Upgrade your Shield, there should be some with higher Armour available. Start filling out your gear with Armour equipment from the vendor, prioritising Red linked sockets. We will be using Dash for movement and Blood and Sand + War Banner auras. Put Steelskin as your Left-click skill. Lastly, link your Reckoning with Onslaught Support.

If you have some leftover currency, get a weapon that has something global in it, such as a Dagger (Global Critical Chance) but NOT a Claw (Life/Leech on Hit is local). Shield Crush does not use any of its stats, so we'll be using our Weapon slot as extra affixes (+Life, +Strength and +Resists are great).

{{< admonition example "Invested Runthru: Shopping List" >}}
Get the following gems from Trade if you can:

- 20+% Quality; Level One <poe-item as-text reference="Qual Dash" icon-inside></poe-item>
- 20+% Quality; Level One <poe-item as-text reference="Divergent Reckoning" icon-inside></poe-item>
- 20+% Quality; Level One <poe-item as-text reference="Anomalous Onslaught Support" icon-inside></poe-item> (link this with Reckoning above)
- 20+% Quality; Level One <poe-item as-text reference="Phantasmal Ancestral Protector" icon-inside></poe-item>

Note that you can reset the level of non-corrupted gems back to level 1 by vendoring it along with an Orb of Regret. It will keep it's alternate form and quality value.

An Ondar's Clasp (Preferably four linked with red sockets) helps with our early game Attack Speed as well:

<poe-item as-icon reference="Ondar's Clasp" icon-size="auto" show-sockets-in-showcase></poe-item>
{{</ admonition >}}

{{< admonition abstract "Initial Runthru: Skip Everything But These..." >}}
- Return to The Submerged Passage, exit to The Ledge
- Run thru The Ledge, activate the waypoint, and continue on to The Climb
- Run thru The Climb, activate the waypoint, and continue on to The Lower Prison
- Activate the waypoint and continue on to The Upper Prison **(Clear the Trial of Ascendancy here)**
- Run thru The Upper Prison, enter The Warden's Quarters and kill Brutus
  - Switch to Blood Stance on boss fights. Don't forget to switch back to Sand after
  - Put down an Ancestral Protector and keep refreshing it every time it expires
  - Apply some bleed then dodge Brutus' AoE to force him to move
- Exit to The Warden's Chambers and to the Prisoner's Gate
- Activate the waypoint, and continue on to The Ship's Graveyard
- Find the waypoint on The Ship's Graveyard. Fairgraves is usually near it; talk to him
- Find The Ship's Graveyard Cave, kill Stranglecharm and loot the Allflame
- Return to The Ship's Graveyard and Fairgraves, and kill him as well **(Skill Book @ Breakpoint)**
- Continue on to The Cavern of Wrath, activate the waypoint and return to Lioneye's Reach
{{</ admonition >}}

### Level 12 at The Cavern of Wrath
Get your quest rewards at Lioneye's Reach. Allocate your skill points, starting by completing the Armor, Evasion and Life wheel, and then going from <poe-passive as-text reference="Art of the Gladiator" icon-outside style="display:inline-block"></poe-passive> towards the <poe-passive as-text reference="Command of Steel" icon-outside style="display:inline-block"></poe-passive> notable.

{{< figure src="/images/eldertuin-lvl-12.png" >}}

 Get an <poe-item as-text reference="Enduring Cry" icon-inside></poe-item>Enduring Cry, <poe-item as-text reference="Vitality" icon-inside></poe-item>Vitality, <poe-item as-text reference="Shield Charge" icon-inside></poe-item>Shield Charge and two <poe-item as-text reference="Lifetap Support" icon-inside></poe-item>Lifetap Support. Once we get the <poe-passive as-text reference="Call to Arms" icon-outside style="display:inline-block"></poe-passive>Call to Arms keystone, we will ditch Steelskin for Enduring Cry as our left-click skill. In the meantime, link a Lifetap to your Shield Crush, and another Lifetap to your Shield Charge. Keep the Lifetap on your Shield Charge at level one. You can put those two gems at your weapon swaps and keep them levelled until we can use them. If you somehow got a Chaos Orb or two by this point, try and trade for a <poe-item as-text reference="Lycosidae"></poe-item>. If you can't, get the highest available armor from the equipment vendor.

 Don't use Shield Crush instead of Dash since our Health Regen isn't that great (yet), and make sure to activate your Vitality aura or you might kill yourself with all the Lifetaps.

{{< admonition example "Invested Runthru: Shopping List" >}}
Get the following gems from Trade if you can:

- 20+% Quality; Level One <poe-item as-text reference="Qual Enduring Cry" icon-inside></poe-item>Enduring Cry
- 20+% Quality; Level One <poe-item as-text reference="Qual Shield Charge" icon-inside></poe-item>Shield Charge

Note that you can reset the level of non-corrupted gems back to level 1 by vendoring it along with an Orb of Regret. It will keep it's alternate form and quality value.

The Shield with the highest possible Armour that you can currently equip is a high quality Lycosidae. It also solves our early game accuracy issues until we get Precision, and then Resolute Technique later. A Wurm's Molt gives us life + mana leech and a good amount of health, and if you are using a Wanderlust, upgrading to a Victario's Flight gives you 5% more move speed.

<poe-item as-icon reference="Lycosidae" icon-size="auto" show-sockets-in-showcase></poe-item>
<poe-item as-icon reference="Wurm's Molt" icon-size="auto"></poe-item>
<poe-item as-icon reference="Victario's Flight" icon-size="auto" show-sockets-in-showcase></poe-item>
{{</ admonition >}}

{{< admonition abstract "Initial Runthru: Skip Everything But These..." >}}
- Return to The Cavern of Wrath, exit to The Cavern of Anger.
- Run thru The Cavern of Anger to Merveil's Lair and kill Merveil.
- Continue to Act 2, The Southern Forest, and exit to The Forest Encampment
- Go thru The Old Fields towards The Crossroads and activate the waypoint there.
- Continue to The Broken Bridge, activate the waypoint, then kill Kraityn.
- Return to the Crossroads and go the The Chamber of Sins Level 1
- Activate the waypoint
