## What is #Dungeon23

As a lifelong devotee of the art of games design, I was delighted to discover the #Dungeon23 challenge created by Sean McCoy of Tuesday Knight Games. This daily writing practice revolves around the construction of a dungeon, with participants crafting a room a day until a complete level is created at the end of the week. The ultimate goal is to create a megadungeon by the end of 2023, consisting of 52 levels. It all started with a tweet and an image of Sean's notebook, and before we knew it the challenge had taken off across Twitter and the indie TTRPG scene.

## My Self-imposed Rules

The unofficial official rules of #Dungeon23 is "A dungeon room a day, every day, for 2023. No Plans. No Overthinking. Randomise. Steal. Simplify." I want to expand these rules, since I want to use the resulting megadungeon in my homebrew setting `Auspex`. Here are my self-imposed rules:

1. At the end of every week for 2023, publish a new dungeon "level".
2. Each level should have at least seven "rooms" and three features.
3. Each feature should have a lore write-up.
4. Every map should be connected (aside from the very first).
  - The resulting megadungeon should be continous.
  - Each map should be 33x24 (A4 size)
5. As much as possible, only the default asset pack of [Dungeondraft](https://dungeondraft.net/) should be used.
