**Customer Journey Expert and Product Owner** <br/>
As one of the Product Owners of ING's customer service application, I was responsible for managing a backlog of features to ensure the application's continous integration and delivery. I work closely with  teams from multiple countries to ensure smooth and efficient delivery of features to the production environment. Moreover, we developed a comprehensive and dynamic integrated test system that could successfully validate and verify the quality of the product releases. This ensured that all releases were successful and there was no need for rollbacks due to any unforeseen issues.

**Lead DotNet Engineer** <br/>
As a DotNet Engineer, I was responsible for establishing coding standards for C# Functions and Azure Pipelines on a new team. Additionally, I engineered the synchronization of data between the legacy ticketing system, Azure, and ING's datalake. I ensured that the data was securely transferred, meeting all the necessary regulatory requirements. I also worked to optimize the pipelines for faster and easier data transfer, allowing for more efficient data management.

**DevOps Engineer** <br/>
As a DevOps Engineer, I collaborated closely with teams from Netherlands and Romania to establish a firm presence in Asia. I provided assistance in setting up automated pipelines from Europe to Asia and Australia via Singapore Data Center, with a comprehensive CI/CD process from code repositories up to production. This included optimizing the pipelines for quicker and more reliable data transfer, ensuring that the data was securely transferred and adhering to all regulatory requirements. Moreover, I also worked to improve visibility and control over the entire CI/CD process, allowing for improved collaboration and more efficient data management.
