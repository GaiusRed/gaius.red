I share my personal experiences and lessons learned in my journey from Engineering to Product Management in my latest article. Check it out!"></div><div class=content id=content><p>In a field as dynamic as IT, change is often the only constant. This rings particularly true for my journey from a hands-on DotNet and DevOps engineer to Product Management, navigating the agile landscape with its emphasis on continuous integration, feedback loops, and quick iteration. The compass guiding me through this voyage has been a principle I&rsquo;ve come to respect and cherish - Intellectual Humility.</p>
<p>The transition from an engineer to product management brought with it a new perspective, a shift from hands-on problem-solving to strategic planning and team guidance. At first, my instinct was to lean on my technical knowledge, anticipating issues and guiding the team&rsquo;s technical direction. However, I quickly recognized the potential and diversity each member of our team brought to the table. Their unique skills and ideas painted a broader, more vibrant picture.</p>
<p>The cornerstone of Intellectual Humility, in my experience, is understanding that our knowledge has its limitations. It&rsquo;s about being receptive to new insights and feedback, recognizing that it&rsquo;s okay to not have all the answers. My role as a leader wasn&rsquo;t to dictate solutions but to trust my team&rsquo;s expertise, allowing them the freedom to innovate, explore, and bring their own insights to the forefront.</p>
<p>Creating a culture of open dialogue and transparency has been an integral part of my journey in product management. Encouraging feedback from my team has not only broadened my perspective but also fostered a sense of mutual respect and collaboration. This practice wasn’t about minimizing my own skills or experiences, but about nurturing an environment that celebrates collective intelligence, where learning is a shared journey.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the principle of Intellectual Humility must walk hand in hand with a &ldquo;trust but verify&rdquo; approach. This balance became glaringly evident during a difficult incident. A misunderstanding led to some miscommunication about a feature that was believed to be blocked due to an external dependency. The reality, however, was that we were inadvertently causing the delay.</p>
<p>This episode served as a gentle reminder that while trust is the foundation of any team, oversight is equally essential. Trusting in my team&rsquo;s abilities or intentions did not have to mean complete abandonment of checks and verification. It was a lesson in understanding that accountability and trust are two sides of the same coin, mutually reinforcing to foster a transparent and reliable work environment.</p>
<p>Applying Intellectual Humility, combined with the principle of &ldquo;trust but verify&rdquo;, has been a learning experience, shaping my approach to tackling challenges. I share these reflections not as an authority on the subject, but as a fellow traveler on the path of continuous growth and learning.</p>
<p>Embracing Intellectual Humility and verifying as necessary isn&rsquo;t about doubting your team&rsquo;s capabilities. Instead, it is about nurturing a shared sense of accountability. For those navigating the ever-changing waters of Agile IT environments, I invite you to try this approach. Allow your team the space to surprise you with their skills and ideas, trust them, but also remember to verify. It’s not a sign of mistrust but a pillar of shared accountability that can lead us to learn, grow, and become more effective in our roles.</p>
<p><img class=lazyload src=/svg/loading.min.svg data-src=/images/navigating-change-2.png data-srcset="/images/navigating-change-2.png, /images/navigating-change-2.png 1.5x, /images/navigating-change-2.png 2x" data-sizes=auto alt=/images/navigating-change-2.png title=Image></p>
<p>In a technical context, Intellectual Humility manifests as an understanding that technology and its applications are ever-evolving landscapes. The solutions and techniques that were deemed best today might be overshadowed by more innovative, effective methodologies tomorrow. This acknowledgment has a direct influence on how we approach problem-solving. It encourages us to stay curious, open to new learning, and readily adaptable to emerging technologies and practices.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s consider a scenario involving the prioritization of our product backlog. As a Product Owner, my role involves making crucial decisions about what features or issues should be tackled next, based on factors like business value, technical feasibility, and team capacity. There were times when my technical background nudged me towards making assumptions about the complexity or feasibility of a particular task. But adhering to Intellectual Humility meant acknowledging that my understanding might be incomplete or outdated. I learned to lean into the collective expertise of my team, fostering a more collaborative and informed decision-making process.</p>
<p>However, this emphasis on humility and trust doesn&rsquo;t absolve us of the need for verification. Going back to the backlog prioritization example, once the team agrees on the next steps, it&rsquo;s crucial to verify these decisions with stakeholders, cross-check the technical dependencies, and ensure we have the resources needed. This is where the &ldquo;trust but verify&rdquo; approach comes into play, serving as a safeguard against miscommunication or oversights, helping maintain transparency and accountability.</p>
<p>Navigating interpersonal relationships and resolving conflicts is another area where these principles have a significant impact. As a Product Owner, my role involves coordinating with multiple stakeholders, from team members and other Product Owners to customers and executives. Each interaction offers unique perspectives and sometimes, conflicting priorities or ideas.</p>
<p>When faced with a conflict, Intellectual Humility guides me to listen actively, value the other person&rsquo;s viewpoint, and be willing to reassess my stance. The &ldquo;trust but verify&rdquo; approach complements this by encouraging me to seek further clarification or evidence to understand the situation better, ensuring that decisions are grounded in fact rather than assumptions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This approach may sound challenging, and honestly, it is. It takes time, patience, and practice. It&rsquo;s about striving for balance - between knowing and learning, confidence and curiosity, trust and verification. But the rewards, in terms of personal growth and effective teamwork, make the journey worthwhile.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Intellectual Humility, by its very essence, is an invitation to ongoing learning. It&rsquo;s about recognizing and respecting the vastness of what we don&rsquo;t know, while also valuing the knowledge we have and the knowledge others bring to the table. It enables us to leverage our collective intelligence, fostering a culture of mutual respect, innovation, and shared learning.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the &ldquo;trust but verify&rdquo; approach offers a practical tool to ensure transparency, accountability, and effective communication. It&rsquo;s not a sign of mistrust, but rather a safeguard to prevent miscommunication and foster mutual accountability. It ensures that trust, the bedrock of any successful team, is accompanied by clarity and understanding.</p>
<p>Together, these principles can guide us in navigating the challenges and complexities we face in our roles. They encourage us to stay open, curious, and adaptable, facilitating our growth and making us more effective in our roles.</p>
<p>In the grand tapestry of Agile IT environments, we are all learners. As we continue to explore and grow in our roles, I invite you to embrace Intellectual Humility and the &ldquo;trust but verify&rdquo; approach. Let these principles guide your journey, shaping your interactions, decision-making process, and approach to problem-solving. It may not always be easy, but the growth and insights gained along the way make the journey worthwhile.</p>
