I am a deity, a spiritual being, as old as the primal energies that birthed the first stars, and I will remain, undying, even after the last stellar giants have exhausted their light and bowed to the inevitable darkness. But now, my focus converges on a soul entrenched in her own convictions—a non-believer named Sarai.</p>
<p>Her existence hums distinctly in the grand tapestry of the universe, a discordant melody that disrupts my divine symphony, yet possesses an undeniable harmony of its own. Sarai—a woman of unyielding resilience, honed by the relentless grindstone of suffering and defiance. Her posture is as rigid as a century-old oak, her gaze as unyielding as hardened obsidian, all directed at me—an enigma she either refuses to understand or is unable to comprehend. She shields her soul within a fortress of disbelief, impervious to divine influence.</p>
<p>She stands upon a vast plain, the verdant carpet of grass under her feet swaying like a sea stirred by an unseen force. Beyond her stretches the horizon, a thin line where earth and sky kiss, a testament to the world&rsquo;s infinite mysteries. The azure canvas overhead is strewn with lazy cotton clouds that amble across the celestial dome, oblivious to the profound confrontation beneath them. Behind her, a solitary tree stands like a silent guardian, its gnarled branches whispering tales of the ages to the winds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;People make their own fate,&rdquo; she says, the strength of her belief imbuing her words with a biting edge. She spits out the words like poison, each syllable a renunciation of the divine. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t need gods to shape our lives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I respond, not with thunderous might, but with the subtle rhythms of nature. I am the tremor beneath her feet, a subtle shiver of the earth that rattles her resolute stance. I am the wind&rsquo;s sigh that toys with the loose strands of her hair, insinuating myself into her guarded space. I am the sun, its harsh but vital glare shining unobstructed onto her upturned face, daring her to deny my existence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sarai,&rdquo; my voice, as timeless as the cosmos, reverberates within her mind. Each syllable echoes in sync with the pulsating rhythm of her heartbeat. &ldquo;Do you truly believe your fate is yours alone to decide?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A silence descends between us—a profound stillness that stretches into infinity—as the beat of her heart falters momentarily. In this lapse, the seed of doubt sows itself. She remains silent, perhaps mulling over the audacity of my question, or maybe the shock of its resonance within her. For the first time, the fortress of her disbelief shudders.</p>
<p>I dive deeper into Sarai&rsquo;s consciousness, not as an intruder but as a guide, gently nudging her towards a revelation that extends beyond her firmly held beliefs. A divine resonance emanates from me, pulsing through her, vibrating in every particle of her being, rippling across the plain that stretches out around us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sarai, consider the world around you. You are a single pebble tossed into a vast lake. Your choices, your actions, they create ripples. Those ripples intersect with others, cascading outwards, far beyond your immediate sight. They echo into the world, the universe even, leaving impressions that last long after your own existence has faded.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She glances around, her dark eyes widening as if taking in the world for the first time. Her gaze roves from the gentle undulation of the grass, each blade dancing to the tune of the wind, to the solitary tree that stands tall, its branches a haven for the avian songsters who add their voices to the grand symphony of existence.</p>
<p>Is it possible, in this moment, that she sees not just a plain but an orchestra of life, a concert of existence playing in harmonious coexistence?</p>
<p>Yet the defiance returns, casting a veil over the burgeoning realization in her eyes. The corners of her mouth tighten, and the softness vanishes, replaced by the hardened lines of skepticism. &ldquo;I control my destiny. I don&rsquo;t need a god to tell me otherwise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sigh of the universe escapes from my formless being—an ancient lamentation that echoes through the eons, felt in the rustle of leaves, the ebb and flow of tides, the turning of celestial bodies.</p>
<p>Her defiance, so seemingly firm, is but a mask, a facade to hide her fear, her desire to control what is ultimately ephemeral and transient. It&rsquo;s a dance as old as existence itself—the mortal&rsquo;s eternal struggle to grasp the elusive currents of destiny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are not a puppet, Sarai, nor a pawn,&rdquo; I tell her, my voice infusing itself into the subtle rhythm of life that hums around her. &ldquo;The web of existence, of actions and reactions, beginnings and consequences—it&rsquo;s not about control. It&rsquo;s about understanding, about recognizing your part in the grand concert of life. You can shape your destiny, but only if you learn to listen to the symphony around you, not deny its existence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A flicker of uncertainty crosses her eyes, like a shadow cast by a cloud passing over the sun. It&rsquo;s a brief interruption in her hardened demeanor, yet it speaks volumes. She&rsquo;s teetering on the edge of a precipice, caught between the comfort of her established beliefs and the unsettling allure of a deeper understanding of her place in the universe.</p>
<p>In this precipitous moment, Sarai stands at the edge of revelation and denial, her beliefs challenged by the whisper of the divine. I watch as her hardened resolve falters, the cracks of uncertainty beginning to fracture her previously impervious wall of disbelief. But even as the divine truth seeps through these cracks, she remains unmoved, a testament to her unyielding spirit.</p>
<p>I do not falter at her continued resistance, for I am not a god of the fervently worshipped, requiring tokens of faith and adoration. I am a god of wisdom, of understanding, seeking not followers but thinkers, not acolytes but questioners. I persist, not because I desire her belief but because I hope for her comprehension.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sarai,&rdquo; I reach out to her again, my voice entwining with the resonances of her existence. &ldquo;Life is not a solitary journey. You are entwined with all existence, with the ebbs and flows of destinies not your own. Accepting this does not diminish your control but enhances it. The first step to mastery is understanding.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The wind picks up, lifting tendrils of her hair, pulling at the loose fabric of her garments. She stands, a silhouette against the canvas of nature, as if her essence is merging with the landscape. She appears smaller, yet not diminished—instead, she is part of a greater whole, a puzzle piece in the grand mosaic of existence.</p>
<p>In her silence, in her internal struggle, I see the seed of doubt beginning to sprout, pushing through the soil of skepticism, reaching for the sunlight of understanding. The mere act of questioning, of self-doubt, demonstrates growth, a shift from passive acceptance to active exploration of her beliefs.</p>
<p>Slowly, I begin to withdraw, not with disappointment but with satisfaction. It is not the blind acceptance of divinity I seek but the ignition of thought, the spark of self-inquiry. Sarai, the non-believer, the skeptic, is now a questioner, a seeker.</p>
<p>For it is not in belief that divinity is found, but in the questioning, the seeking. And in her quest, she may yet discover that the divine is not an external entity to be denied or accepted, but a resonance within herself, an echo of the cosmos, a participant in the grand symphony of existence.</p>
<p>So, I recede, leaving her with her thoughts, her doubts, her new path of self-exploration. My formless presence fades from her consciousness, but the divine whisper remains, a reminder of her part in the cosmic dance.</p>
<p>For even a non-believer, when willing to question, can find their path to the divine.</p></div><div class=post-footer id=post-footer>
