# Eldertuin The Fortress

<!--more-->
## Abstract

This build is centered on taking advantage of <poe-item as-text reference="Headhunter" icon-inside></poe-item> buffs. It has decent Armour, maximum Block and high Attack Speed to apply multiple Impales &amp; Bleeds via <poe-item as-text reference="Shield Crush" icon-inside></poe-item>. In adddition, the build uses <poe-item as-text reference="Inspired Learning" icon-inside></poe-item> while levelling, mapping and saving currency for an actual Headhunter, and sacrifices some "on paper" DPS in order to ensure that every stolen buff will be beneficial.

Without stolen buffs, this build can deal 2.9m Combined DPS, has 190k Phys eHP and 100k Elemental eHP. This build was made in Softcore Trade league. It is not SSF viable due to the uniques required, and it MAY be Hardcore viable (untested). This can also be used as a league starter.

## Key Mechanics

### Attack Speed

This build relies on hitting the target many times per second in order to leech life and stack multiple Impales and Bleeds as fast as possible.

A high quality <poe-item as-text reference="Shield Crush" icon-inside></poe-item> gives 11% increased attack speed, plus its Eternal Labyrinth <poe-item as-text reference="Helm Enchant" label-text="Helm Enchant" icon-inside></poe-item> grants an additional 15%. It is also linked to a high quality <poe-item as-text reference="Divergent Multistrike Support" icon-inside></poe-item> for another 11% increase. From our gear, we're using a triple green <poe-item as-text reference="Prismatic Eclipse" icon-inside show-sockets-in-showcase></poe-item> that gives us 36% increased attack speed. We also have two 5% increased Attack Speed <poe-item as-text reference="Abyss Jewel" label-text="abyss jewels" icon-inside></poe-item> on <poe-item as-text reference="Darkness Enthroned" icon-inside></poe-item>, giving us 15%, as well as <poe-passive as-text reference="Ambidexterity" icon-outside style="display:inline-block"></poe-passive> anointed on our amulet for an extra 20%.

With our gems & equipment giving us about 100% increase, our passive tree, Gladiator ascendancy and cluster jewel (<poe-passive as-text reference="Feed the Fury" icon-outside style="display:inline-block"></poe-passive> and <poe-passive as-text reference="Fuel the Fight" icon-outside style="display:inline-block"></poe-passive>) gives us a total of about 200% increased attack speed. <poe-item as-text reference="Divergent Multistrike Support" icon-inside></poe-item> gives us 44% more, a high quality <poe-item as-text reference="Phantasmal Ancestral Protector" icon-inside></poe-item> gives us 24% more and each of the ten Challenger Charges (from Gladiator's <poe-passive as-text reference="Arena Challenger" icon-outside style="display:inline-block"></poe-passive>) gives us 2% more for a total of 88% more attack speed.

This should push us above **8 attacks per second** before stolen buffs. At the hideout, without Challenger charges, Onslaught and attack speed bonuses while Fortified and while Leeching, the build should have about 5.5 attacks per second on the character sheet. Note that we are ignoring accuracy since we're using a <poe-item as-text reference="Prismatic Eclipse" icon-inside show-sockets-in-showcase></poe-item> with the <poe-passive as-text reference="Resolute Technique" icon-outside style="display:inline-block"></poe-passive> corruption, which means our hits cannot be evaded at the cost of never critting.

{{< admonition tip "Tip! A corrupted item's socket number, color & links can still be modified in the crafting bench." false >}}
Since this build uses a corrupted <poe-item as-text reference="Prismatic Eclipse" icon-inside show-sockets-in-showcase></poe-item> with specific socket number and colors, take note that you can buy the cheapest item with the correct corruption and resocket/recolor it on your crafting bench.
{{< /admonition >}}

### Impale & Bleed

Even though Shield Crush can deal a significant amount of damage by itself (esp. with a high Armour shield), the build deals approx. half of its damage via Impale and Bleed stacking. Both of these mechanics takes advantage of the build's high attack speed.

[Impale](https://www.poewiki.net/wiki/Impale) stores 10% of the initial hit's Physical damage, and deals the recorded damage to the target each time it is hit again. It remains until the maximum of 5 impale stacks is reached, which we are able to apply in one second. This is why we are aiming for at least 6 attacks per second. In addition, we also try increase the stored hit using increased Impale Effect via our high quality <poe-item as-text reference="Impale Support" icon-inside></poe-item>, two 6% increased Impale Effect <poe-item as-text reference="Abyss Jewel" label-text="abyss jewels" icon-inside></poe-item> on <poe-item as-text reference="Darkness Enthroned" icon-inside></poe-item>, <poe-passive as-text reference="Forceful Skewering" icon-outside style="display:inline-block"></poe-passive> and <poe-passive as-text reference="Swift Skewering" icon-outside style="display:inline-block"></poe-passive> for a **total of 17.9% stored hit**. These two notables also push our Impale Chance from 60% to max out at 100%.

We also apply eight [Bleed](https://www.poewiki.net/wiki/Bleeding) debuffs via <poe-passive as-text reference="Crimson Dance" icon-outside style="display:inline-block"></poe-passive>, dealing 35% of the inflicting attack's Physical damage over 5 seconds for each stack.

For an easier time clearing maps, we are also using <poe-item as-text reference="Haemophilia" icon-inside></poe-item> to make bleeding enemies explode on death, dealing 5% of their max life as physical damage. It also has increased attack damage against Bleeding enemies, which stack with <poe-passive as-text reference="Bloodletting" icon-outside style="display:inline-block"></poe-passive>. Haemophilia, the nodes before Bloodletting, the nodes before <poe-passive as-text reference="Dirty Techniques" icon-outside style="display:inline-block"></poe-passive> and our Vulnerability curse on hit Ring gives us a total of 96% Chance to Bleed on hit.

### Inspired Learning

The <poe-item as-text reference="Headhunter" icon-inside></poe-item> unique belt is one of the most iconic items in Path of Exile. It has the extremely powerful mod `When you kill a Rare monster, you gain its Modifiers for 20 seconds`, especially since every Rare monster would have at least three modifiers. It is also the rarest item in the game, with the lowest chance of dropping (or being chanced), which means it is also one of the most expensive. <poe-item as-text reference="Inspired Learning" icon-inside></poe-item>, on the other hand, "only" steals one Modifier from slain Rare monsters, and is far more common than a Headhunter. Click [here](https://www.poewiki.net/wiki/Headhunter#Effects) to see a partial list of effects that can be stolen.

Inspired Learning is different from Headhunter in two other ways: it is a Jewel instead of a Belt, and it requires four allocated notables inside of a small radius in order to activate. The build puts Inspired Learning at the Jewel Socket south of the starting position of the Duelist, and allocate <poe-passive as-text reference="Vigour" icon-outside style="display:inline-block"></poe-passive>, <poe-passive as-text reference="Golem's Blood" icon-outside style="display:inline-block"></poe-passive>, <poe-passive as-text reference="Cloth and Chain" icon-outside style="display:inline-block"></poe-passive> and <poe-passive as-text reference="Dirty Techniques" icon-outside style="display:inline-block"></poe-passive> to activate it.

Note that even though the stolen buffs stack, their duration is not reset for each Rare monster slain. This is why we are using <poe-item as-text reference="Solstice Vigil" icon-inside></poe-item>'s buff (Shaper's Presence) to increase the stolen buff's duration by 10%. It also negates Temporal Chain's reservation cost when cast as an aura, which we use to curse ourselves (and everyone near us) via <poe-item as-text reference="Rotblood Promise" icon-inside></poe-item>. Since we do not want our action speed to be reduced, we are using a high quality but level one <poe-item as-text reference="Temporal Chains" icon-inside></poe-item>. The final effect of Shaper's Presence and the self curse would be 9% less action speed but **29% more stolen buff duration**.

Since we are already using a Vulnerability curse on hit Ring, we can either use a Solstice Vigil with a very rare `You can apply an additionl Curse` corruption, or use a Windshriek (or a Windscream while levelling).

{{< admonition question "Why use Elemental Damage with Attacks when Brutality gives way more damage?" >}}
Speaking of Headhunter buffs, there are monster affixes that we can steal but do not benefit us. With <poe-passive as-text reference="Resolute Technique" icon-outside style="display:inline-block"></poe-passive>, we cannot take advantage of Critical Strike/Multiplier affixes as well as those that generate Power Charges, since we do not crit.

If we use <poe-item as-text reference="Brutality Support" icon-inside></poe-item>, monster affixes that add Physical Damage as Extra Elemental Damage also becomes negated, which is why we use <poe-item as-text reference="Elemental Damage with Attacks Support" icon-inside></poe-item> instead. It also allows us to use a <poe-item as-text reference="Mantra of Flames" icon-inside></poe-item>.
{{</ admonition >}}

### Armour & Block

With almost 3000 Armour on our shield and almost all of our gems being red, we are going to have a lot of Armour. We also get several nodes on the passive tree that increase our Armour, plus we're using a high quality <poe-item as-text reference="Anomalous Defiance Banner" icon-inside></poe-item> and a high quality <poe-item as-text reference="Anomalous Flesh and Stone" icon-inside></poe-item>. At endgame (without stolen buffs), we should have about 27,000 total Armour for about 86% Physical Damage Reduction.

The build takes almost every `chance to block` node on the passive tree that is near the Duelist. We are also using a <poe-item as-text reference="Colossal Tower Shield" label-text="Colossal Tower Shield" icon-inside></poe-item> with a minimum of 26% Chance to Block and each of our three <poe-item as-text reference="Jewel" label-text="jewels" icon-inside></poe-item> should have +1% chance to block for a total of 70% Attack & Spell block chance on hideout. It maxes out to **79% Chance to Block Attack and Spell damage** on combat, thanks to Gladiator's <poe-passive as-text reference="Versatile Combatant" icon-outside style="display:inline-block"></poe-passive> & <poe-passive as-text reference="Violent Retaliation" icon-outside style="display:inline-block"></poe-passive>.

We also have <poe-passive as-text reference="Vigour" icon-outside label-text="four" style="display:inline-block"></poe-passive> Endurance Charges (generated via instant (<poe-passive as-text reference="Call to Arms" icon-outside style="display:inline-block"></poe-passive>) <poe-item as-text reference="Enduring Cry" icon-inside></poe-item>) for 16% elemental and physical resist. Along with 10% Fortify effect from the <poe-passive as-text reference="Rampart" icon-outside style="display:inline-block"></poe-passive> wheel that gives us 22% less damage from hits, most of the damage that goes thru our block chance should be sufficiently mitigated.

### Reckoning

Even though the build is using a <poe-item as-text reference="Reckoning" icon-inside></poe-item> for extra Maim chance, Onslaught chance and Life on Hit, this is actually a customizable four-link. Feel free to get some lightning golems, spectres, animated guardian or any other four-link instead. Even with Gladiator's <poe-passive as-text reference="Painforged" icon-outside style="display:inline-block"></poe-passive>, Reckoning still barely deals any damage.

### Movement & Utility Skills

We already have a high Armour shield so the build uses <poe-item as-text reference="Shield Charge" icon-inside></poe-item> as its movement skill linked with a high quality <poe-item as-text reference="Fortify" icon-inside></poe-item>. We also have a <poe-item as-text reference="Vaal Ancestral Warchief" icon-inside></poe-item> for extra single target DPS.

Since we have to use a triple green <poe-item as-text reference="Prismatic Eclipse" icon-inside show-sockets-in-showcase></poe-item>, we can put a <poe-item as-text reference="Cast on Death" icon-inside></poe-item> linked with a <poe-item as-text reference="Portal" icon-inside></poe-item> there, as well as an unlinked high quality <poe-item as-text reference="Dash" icon-inside></poe-item> in case we need to use a blink skill in an emergency.

## Gear, Flasks & Gems

### Equipment

Here are the unique equipment that the build uses:

<poe-item as-icon reference="Prismatic Eclipse" icon-size="auto" show-sockets-in-showcase></poe-item>
<poe-item as-icon reference="Haemophilia" icon-size="auto" show-sockets-in-showcase></poe-item>
<poe-item as-icon reference="Windshriek" icon-size="auto" show-sockets-in-showcase></poe-item><br/><br/>
<poe-item as-icon reference="Solstice Vigil" icon-size="auto"></poe-item>
<poe-item as-icon reference="Rotblood Promise" icon-size="auto" show-sockets-in-showcase></poe-item>
<poe-item as-icon reference="Darkness Enthroned" icon-size="auto" show-sockets-in-showcase></poe-item>

Anoint <poe-passive as-text reference="Ambidexterity" icon-outside style="display:inline-block"></poe-passive> on the Solstice Vigil using an Amber, an Azure and a Black Oil.

On the remaining slots, prioritize Rare equipment that has Armour, Maximum Life, Chaos Resists and Elemental Resists. The Helmet should have the Eternal Labyrinth enchant `15% Increased Shield Crush Attack Speed` and your Ring should have the Warlord influence mod `Curse Enemies with Vulnerability on Hit`. Your Rare shield should have 3000 Armour minimum, and at least 26% Chance to Block.

<poe-item as-icon reference="Helm Enchant" icon-size="auto" show-sockets-in-showcase></poe-item>
<poe-item as-icon reference="Body Armour" icon-size="auto" show-sockets-in-showcase></poe-item>
<poe-item as-icon reference="Armour Shield" icon-size="auto" show-sockets-in-showcase></poe-item>
<poe-item as-icon reference="Ring" icon-size="auto"></poe-item>

### Jewels (Abyss, Base & Cluster)

Because more than half of this build's gear is unique, any Rare item that can have Resistance and Life should have it. Prioritize Chaos Resist, Elemental Resist and Maximum Life on Rare Jewels. Unfortunately, these are the most expensive pieces used by the build.

<poe-item as-icon reference="Abyss Jewel" icon-size="auto"></poe-item>
<poe-item as-icon reference="Abyss Jewel 2" icon-size="auto"></poe-item>

The two Abyss Jewels socketed on <poe-item as-text reference="Darkness Enthroned" icon-inside></poe-item> should both have `5% Increased Attack Speed` and `6% Increased Impale Effect` affixes.

<poe-item as-icon reference="Inspired Learning" icon-size="auto"></poe-item>
<poe-item as-icon reference="Mantra of Flames" icon-size="auto"></poe-item>
<poe-item as-icon reference="Lethal Pride" icon-size="auto"></poe-item>
<poe-item as-icon reference="Jewel" icon-size="auto"></poe-item>
<poe-item as-icon reference="Cluster Jewel" icon-size="auto"></poe-item>

We are using the following Jewels on the Passive Tree. The build can use three base jewels, and each should have `+1% Chance to Block Attack Damage while holding a Shield` affix.

The Cluster Jewel should have Eight passive skills, `12% increased Attack Damage while holding a Shield` affix, <poe-passive as-text reference="Feed the Fury" icon-outside style="display:inline-block"></poe-passive> and <poe-passive as-text reference="Fuel the Fight" icon-outside style="display:inline-block"></poe-passive>.

### Flasks

<poe-item as-icon reference="Blood of the Karui" icon-size="auto"></poe-item>
<poe-item as-icon reference="Lion's Roar" icon-size="auto"></poe-item><br/>
<poe-item as-icon reference="Basalt Flask" icon-size="auto"></poe-item>
<poe-item as-icon reference="Quartz Flask" icon-size="auto"></poe-item>
<poe-item as-icon reference="Quicksilver Flask" icon-size="auto"></poe-item>

### Skill Gem Links

Note that Awakened, Alternate and Quality Corruption on gems are not required by the build. Feel free to use gems from Lily Roth.

### Ascendancy

Get the following Gladiator ascendancy notables in this order:

1. <poe-passive as-text reference="Arena Challenger" icon-outside style="display:inline-block"></poe-passive>
2. <poe-passive as-text reference="Painforged" icon-outside style="display:inline-block"></poe-passive>
3. <poe-passive as-text reference="Versatile Combatant" icon-outside style="display:inline-block"></poe-passive>
4. <poe-passive as-text reference="Violent Retaliation" icon-outside style="display:inline-block"></poe-passive>

## Bandit & Pantheon

We need every passive point we can get: **Kill All Bandits**. As for the pantheon, it's especially tricky to get Chaos Resistance, so I recommend the **Soul of Arakaali** (5% Reduced Damage from DoT) with the Witch of the Cauldron (+25% Chaos Res. vs DoT) and the **Soul of Shakari** (5% Reduced Chaos Damage).

## Frequently Asked Questions

Can I use this build to farm...

- Bestiary: Yes. Bestiary monsters are Rare monsters that we can steal buffs from.
- Delve: Kinda. We don't have that much firepower to get into deep delving.
- Incursion: Yes, but Leap Slam would be a better movement skill rather than Shield Charge.
- Betrayal: Kinda. Not enough Rare monsters.
- Breach: Yes. Again, Leap Slam would be better especially on maps with elevation changes.
- Harbinger: Yes. The Harbingers can create multiple Rare monsters.
- Abyss: Yes. Everytime the Abyss "crack" stops, it always spawns at least one rare.
- Legion: Kinda. Something that Chains would be better, but the Bleed pop helps.
- Blight: Kinda. Same as Legion above.
- Metamorph: Kinda. When the unique summons its rare mobs, the fight will suddenly become easier.
- Delirium: Kinda. The fog does not spawn many Rare monsters.
- Harvest: Yes. Focus on the big seeds to steal their buff, then clean up.
- Heist: Yes. After the alarm, Rare monsters spawn a lot.
- Ritual: Yes. Starting at the third Ritual, a lot of Rares are spawned.
- Expedition: Yes. Rare monsters spawned always have Ward, so burst those down first.

How do you sustain mana when 98% of your mana is reserved?

- I don't. All active skills are linked to <poe-item as-text reference="Lifetap Support" icon-inside></poe-item>.

Why is this build named `Eldertuin The Fortress`?

- I randomly got an <poe-item as-text reference="Inspired Learning" icon-inside></poe-item> while gambling with Expedition League's Gwennen. I was already looking for another build to make, having about 10 watchstones unlocked on the atlas, so I decided to check where I can use the mini headhunter jewel. When I saw that the socket near Duelist is easy to get, with access to an Endurance, Armor, Life and Bleed notables, I decided to make a Shield Crush + Shield Charge build. The name of the build came from the web serial [The Wandering Inn](http://wanderinginn.com), where there's an adventurer named `Eldertuin The Fortress` who is known from using his shields. Also, this build uses a <poe-item as-text reference="Solstice Vigil" icon-inside></poe-item>, which is very apt considering the events currently unfolding at Book 8.
