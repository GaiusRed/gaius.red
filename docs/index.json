First and foremost, I am also a member of the Millennial generation. Specifically, I’m an “elder millennial,” to borrow a phrase from Iliza Shlesinger. This is not an attempt to start a fight or stir up controversy; rather, it is a personal account of a problem I faced and how I overcame it. When I was still a software engineer, I encountered numerous bugs, issues, and impediments. When I inevitably run into one, I have learned from my more experienced coworkers to find an expert right away who can help me solve the problem at hand. Alternatively, if I am unable to identify an expert in a specific area, I have also learned that reaching out to my Product Owner is very beneficial. POs are well-connected with stakeholders who possess the necessary skills and knowledge to help me overcome obstacles. By closely working with POs, I can leverage their network and identify the appropriate person who can offer me the necessary guidance and expertise. Now that I’m the Product Owner in charge of a team of engineers' backlog, I’ve noticed a few things. First, all of my engineers are younger millennials, and second, the issues that they are dealing with are a lot more complex than what I had encountered before. I thought it was just an experience or training gap, but as we worked together more, I saw that I was lucky to have brilliant engineers on my team. However, when they bring up issues during our stand ups and retrospectives, it’s always a lot more complicated than what I was expecting. During one of our meetings, I finally realized what the difference was when one of our engineers explained an issue to me. After they told me what was going on, but before I was able to get a word in to clarify something, the engineer started listing the solutions that they had tried to solve the problem. Each of these solutions had specific drawbacks and a well-considered explanation for why it wouldn’t solve our initial problem. I expected them to try to solve problems before requesting assistance, but not like this. Looking back at our previous impediments, it appears that almost always, a younger millennial will opt to try each solution out and explore the problem space before asking for help. It seems as though they would always opt to prepare beforehand because they expect to be questioned about why they did not do this or that before reaching out for support. At first, this may sound good. Why wouldn’t an engineer try to figure things out before seeking assistance? However, the end result is typically a worker who never asks for help. In the rare cases when they do ask for support, their question is incredibly nuanced and difficult to solve. Even in the cases where they didn’t ask for help, they may have spent more time and effort exploring the problem space than simply sending a message to a domain expert. This situation can cause a lot of frustration and confusion in the workplace as the engineer spends hours trying to figure out a problem that could have been solved in a few minutes by simply asking someone else. When I realized the difference between my working style and that of my younger colleagues, I confided with a mentor and asked if they had seen this behavior before. We learned that colleagues from the generation before us, or those who worked primarily with the last generation, have encountered similar issues with the upcoming millennial generation. We kept talking about this problem, and when we brought in more coworkers and some younger engineers, we came up with a solution. We should look at a problem (bug, issue, impediment, etc.) as if it were a tree, and its solutions would be its stems and leaves. Younger millennials tend to look at the whole tree, going through the “stems” or solutions that they can see. When they finally ask for help, they will list the problems they have run into whil","date":"2023-02-28","objectID":"/generational-shift-in-solving-issues/:0:0","tags":["Product Management","Work","Millenial"],"title":"A Generational Shift in Solving Issues","uri":"/generational-shift-in-solving-issues/"},{"categories":["Work"],"content":"The issue for DevOps and Product Management is the same: How can we create the smallest possible change with the greatest potential impact?","date":"2023-01-24","objectID":"/devops-and-product-mgmt/","tags":["DevOps","Product Management","Work"],"title":"What I Learned From DevOps, Applied to Product Management","uri":"/devops-and-product-mgmt/"},{"categories":["Work"],"content":"It has been several enlightening months since I transitioned from a DevOps Engineering role to being a Product Owner. I have learned a lot from my colleagues who have been in the role for years, but there are also certain aspects that have been unique to my experience, such as the use of agile principles and applying DevOps principles to product management. As the owner of a product, most of the value you provide comes from pushing the features of your product forward. This requires understanding what the customer wants, how the product needs to be built and deployed, and ensuring that there is a plan to deliver on time. This is where I first noticed the overlap between the principles of DevOps and those of product management. At the heart of both disciplines is the idea that small changes can have a big impact on the success of an organization or product. The issue for both is the same: How can we create the smallest possible change with the greatest potential impact? By applying DevOps-style continuous integration (CI) during product development, product managers are able to identify areas for improvement faster and more accurately, as well as quickly deploy changes with minimal disruption. One of the ways that this can be done is by dramatically reducing the size of features before implementation. Teams can then test various iterations quickly and effectively before moving forward. Additionally, DevOps' continuous feedback loops make sure that problems are found and fixed right away. The same principle applies to product management: understanding user needs through feedback loops and weekly catchup meetings helps us make better decisions about what we’re building and how we’re building it. Inter-team collaboration is another area that DevOps (and being Agile in general) emphasize. Product managers should take this same approach in order to realize their product vision. Working with everyone from different domains ensures that all stakeholders understand how their work impacts the final product and ultimately the customer experience. By taking advantage of everything DevOps has taught us, product managers can create more efficient processes, smarter products, and happier customers.

Impale stores 10% of the initial hit’s Physical damage, and deals the recorded damage to the target each time it is hit again. It remains until the maximum of 5 impale stacks is reached, which we are able to apply in one second. This is why we are aiming for at least 6 attacks per second.

Why is this build named Eldertuin The Fortress? I randomly got an while gambling with Expedition League’s Gwennen. I was already looking for another build to make, having about 10 watchstones unlocked on the atlas, so I decided to check where I can use the mini headhunter jewel. When I saw that the socket near Duelist is easy to get, with access to an Endurance, Armor, Life and Bleed notables, I decided to make a Shield Crush + Shield Charge build.
