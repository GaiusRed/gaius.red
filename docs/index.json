This has resulted in leadership that thrives on publicity—positive or negative—to secure re-election rather than focusing on long-term national interests. Moreover, short electoral terms hinder sustained progress on critical issues such as climate change, education reform, and healthcare improvements. The frequent overturning of policies with each new administration disrupts continuity and impedes the implementation of visionary projects that require stability beyond election cycles.

At its core are values such as: Meritocracy: Recognizing individuals based on their academic achievements and contributions. Integrity: Upholding ethical standards within academia to ensure noble titles reflect true intellectual prowess. Inclusivity: Ensuring equal access to educational opportunities so all citizens can aspire toward nobility regardless of socioeconomic status. Global Competitiveness: Maintaining rigorous standards in higher education aligned with international benchmarks. Transparency: Conducting audits openly so public trust is maintained in both governmental operations and academic institutions. Through these guiding tenets, we envision a society where those equipped with knowledge lead—not just because they seek power but because they are best positioned to wield it wisely for societal advancement.

At its helm stands the Monarch—King or Queen—a figurehead who not only symbolizes the pinnacle of academic nobility but also wields substantial influence over national policy and direction. Composition: The Monarch presides over an assembly of Royal Secretaries, each heading a Royal Department akin to traditional ministerial portfolios such as Defense, Education, Health, among others. These Secretaries are nominated by the reigning Monarch from amongst their fellow nobles and confirmed by legislative consensus—ensuring that those at the vanguard of state affairs are both academically credentialed and politically astute. Succession: Upon vacancy in this esteemed office—be it through abdication due to loss of noble status or retirement—the mantle passes not hereditarily but through preferential election within academia’s elite echelons. Every citizen bearing a noble title casts their vote for one among the High Houses deemed eligible; these votes are tallied meticulously by an impartial Commission on Higher Education, Statistics and Elections. This process ensures continuity without stagnation; while dynastic legacies may persist across generations if they maintain their scholastic standing, no single lineage can claim perpetual rule absent continual intellectual achievement. Noble Patronage System: A unique facet is the system’s patronage structure wherein tax incentives intertwine with academic prestige. Each House—from Minor, High to the Monarch itself—bestows upon select corporations fiscal privileges in exchange for displaying prominently their seal. Such alliances foster symbiotic relationships between commerce and aristocracy; businesses thrive under reduced levies whilst simultaneously bolstering noble houses' stature—an intricate dance balancing economic vitality against potential nepotism safeguards. In essence, this executive framework weaves together strands of knowledge with threads of power into a tapestry reflecting the manifesto’s ethos: leadership rooted firmly in rationality yet responsive to society’s broader needs—a beacon guiding towards enlightened governance amidst tumultuous seas wrought by less discerning systems prior.

This dual representation ensures that both the intellectual elite and the general populace have a voice in crafting legislation. The High Houses' Chamber: Composition: The chamber comprises representatives from each of the fifteen High Houses, entities distinguished by their unwavering commitment to scholarly pursuits across generations. Appointment: By default, Heads of these illustrious families assume their seats; however, they may nominate other noble titleholders within their lineage as proxies should circumstances necessitate. Responsibilities: These erudite legislators review bills passed by the Commons’ Hall, imbuing them with scholarly insight and ensuring alignment with long-term national interests rooted in scientific advancement and cultural enrichment. Powers: With veto rights over legislation deemed antithetical to academic integrity or societal progress, this assembly wields significant influence over national policy direction. The Commons' Hall: Composition: Reflecting society’s diverse tapestry, 250 members are elected based on geographical districts proportional to population density alongside sectoral party-lists representing various citizen interests. Election Cycle \u0026 Term Limits: Every three years citizens engage in electing these representatives who serve no more than three terms—whether consecutive or not—to foster fresh perspectives while preventing political stagnation. Interplay Between Chambers: Deliberative Process: Legislation originates within the vibrant debates of Commons’ Hall before ascending to contemplative scrutiny among High House peers—a testament to the system’s respect for grassroots initiatives tempered by scholarly oversight. Deadlock Resolution Mechanisms include joint private conferences aimed at reconciling differences through dialogue; public hearings that invite civic engagement; royal sessions initiated by sovereign decree when impasses persist; time lapse provisions granting victory to the Common Hall’s consensus if resolution remains elusive after prescribed durations. Checks \u0026 Balances: Each chamber exercises checks upon its counterpart—the commons scrutinizing nobility-driven agendas for populist resonance while high houses ensure proposals bear intellectual rigor’s hallmark—thus maintaining equilibrium between popular will and enlightened governance. In summary, the structure of the legislative branch is designed to balance the voice of the people with the expertise of scholars: It combines democratic principles with academic excellence; It encourages active discussions where every law is shaped by both common interests and scholarly knowledge; And it ensures that decisions are made based on informed understanding and not just popularity or pressure.

Its composition mirrors that of traditional supreme courts but operates within an intellectual framework that emphasizes scholarly achievement alongside jurisprudential expertise. Composition: The judiciary is headed by a Chief Justice, supported by fourteen Associate Justices. These justices are selected based on their profound understanding of law, extensive experience in legal practice or academia, and unwavering commitment to upholding justice without prejudice. Qualifications: Each candidate for the bench must possess at least fifteen years cumulative experience as a judge in lower courts or have practiced law while maintaining good standing within the Bar for an equivalent duration. This ensures that only those with seasoned judgment and deep-rooted knowledge ascend to these esteemed positions. Nomination Process: The Executive Branch nominates candidates for all judicial positions; however, it does not act unilaterally—each nomination requires confirmation from both houses of the Legislative Branch. Confirmation Hearings: A rigorous vetting process ensues wherein nominees undergo thorough examination by legislators from both the High Houses' Chamber and the Commons' Hall—a testament to democratic engagement even within this academically inclined system. Tenure: Once confirmed, justices serve until they reach mandatory retirement age, ensuring continuity and stability within the judiciary while allowing periodic infusion of new intellectual blood into its ranks. Independence \u0026 Checks: To maintain independence from political influence or academic pressure, justices cannot be removed except through impeachment proceedings initiated by legislative consensus—an arduous process safeguarding against capricious dismissal yet providing accountability for misconduct. Role \u0026 Responsibilities: The primary role involves constitutional review—assessing whether executive actions align with established laws—and statutory interpretation where ambiguity arises in legislation passed down from bicameral deliberations between the High Houses' Chamber and the Commons' Hall. Jurisdictional Authority: Their jurisdiction spans across civil liberties disputes, criminal cases, administrative law challenges, and other matters requiring adjudication under national statutes or international treaties ratified by the Monarch. Decision-Making Protocol: Decisions are reached through collegial deliberation aiming at consensus ; however , when differing opinions persist , majority rule applies . Dissenting voices may pen separate opinions showing alternative viewpoints — a reflection upon the discourse valued amongst intellectuals. Transparency \u0026 Public Trust: Proceedings are generally open to public scrutiny unless confidentiality serves greater interests such as national security concerns — this transparency fosters trust among citizenry who entrust these learned individuals with guardianship over fundamental rights enshrined within the societal fabric. In summary, the Judicial Branch stands as a pillar of wisdom and legal insight. Its main duty is not just to interpret laws but also to nurture the principles that give life to the system of governance, which values academic achievement above all. The branch ensures fairness and upholds rights while contributing to the education of future leaders.

The Noble Dynasties The foundation of an Academic Aristocracy is the establishment of Noble Dynasties, which are the bedrock upon which intellectual leadership is built and sustained. A Noble Dynasty, also known as a Noble House, represents a lineage of individuals who have consistently demonstrated academic excellence and contributed significantly to the scientific community. To establish a new Noble Dynasty, one must meet stringent criteria that ensure only those with substantial academic achievements can lay claim to nobility. The initial criterion requires an adult individual (18 years or older) to possess either multiple Master’s degrees across different disciplines—one in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) and another in Liberal Arts or Military Science—or hold a Doctorate degree in any field. Upon meeting these requirements and contributing meaningfully to their respective fields through research or practice, an individual may initiate their own Noble House. However, this status is not permanent by default; it must be maintained through successive generations. For a dynasty to retain its noble standing: Each generation within the dynasty must produce at least one member who fulfills the same educational criteria. This standard must be upheld for at least three consecutive generations before official recognition as a stable Noble House is granted. Should any generation fail to meet these standards—failing to achieve requisite academic qualifications—their house will forfeit its noble status until such time as they can re-establish their credentials over subsequent generations. It should be noted that marriage into a Nobel House does not automatically confer full membership within that house; rather, spouses without independent noble titles are designated Lord/Lady Consorts—a half-member status—and do not contribute towards maintaining the dynastic line’s count of Nobles required for High House consideration unless they independently attain noble status through academia. Children born from such unions are considered full members of their non-consort parent’s house but bear responsibility for continuing their family’s legacy by achieving similar levels of scholarly distinction themselves. In summary: To begin: An adult with advanced degrees contributes academically. To maintain: Successive generations uphold educational achievement. To lose: Failure by any generation results in loss of nobility until redeemed by future successions. These measures ensure that each established Nobel Dynasty remains committed—not just nominally but substantively—to fostering intellectual growth and leadership within society while preventing stagnation or decline into mere titular aristocracy devoid of genuine meritocratic substance.

It is during this time that the Commission on Higher Education, Statistics, and Elections (CHESE) undertakes a comprehensive census to determine which Noble Dynasties have upheld their scholarly legacy with distinction. Each year, CHESE meticulously counts and verifies the number of adult Nobles below retirement age within each Noble Dynasty. This count does not include Lord/Lady Consorts unless they have independently achieved noble status through academic excellence as per established criteria. Once tallied, these figures are compared across all existing Noble Dynasties to identify the top fifteen families distinguished by their intellectual contributions and academic prowess. These elite dynasties are then bestowed with the honorific title of ‘High House,’ granting them significant influence in both legislative affairs and potential ascension to executive leadership. This system ensures dynamic competition among houses while fostering continuous dedication to scholarship; it also prevents stagnation by allowing new bloodlines to rise based on meritocratic principles rather than hereditary rights alone.

When an Executive Branch vacancy arises—be it from loss of status, mandatory retirement or impeachment—all titled nobility convene in solemn assembly. During this critical juncture, each noble casts a preferential vote indicating their choice amongst eligible High Houses for succession into executive power. The process is conducted privately but mandated by law—a testament to the nobility’s commitment towards transparency without sacrificing decorum befitting one’s station.

Each representative carries the weight of their constituents' aspirations and concerns, ensuring that legislation is rooted in practical realities and public sentiment. Bills are introduced after meticulous drafting sessions, often involving consultations with experts from various fields to ensure a robust foundation for potential laws. Once tabled, these proposals should undergo rigorous debate; each clause scrutinized, every implication considered. The process is democratic yet disciplined—a testament to the belief that good governance emerges from thorough examination rather than hasty consensus. Upon reaching a majority vote within this chamber, a bill earns its passage but does not yet claim victory—it must withstand another layer of scrutiny under an entirely different gaze: that of the High Houses' Chamber.

Herein lies an assembly whose members have been shaped by generations committed to scholarly excellence—an aristocracy not merely inherited but earned through relentless pursuit of knowledge. The Representatives of the High Houses should dissect each provision with analytical precision born out of years spent within academia’s challenging arenas. Their amendments should not be mere alterations, but enhancements informed by empirical evidence and theoretical frameworks spanning diverse disciplines. This iterative process between both chambers ensures that legislation is tempered like steel—with strength derived from repeated forging between practicality and expertise until consensus is achieved or compromise reached.

Here, in a role that blends tradition with responsibility, the King or Queen examines the proposed law through a lens of national interest and societal values. The Monarch consults with experts from various Royal Departments to ensure that every aspect of governance is considered. If they find that the bill aligns well with these principles, it receives royal assent and becomes law. However, if there are concerns about its impact or content, a veto may be issued—sending it back for further discussion and improvement. This final step ensures that all new laws have been carefully considered at every level—from their roots among everyday people to their refinement by academic minds—and ultimately judged by a leader dedicated to upholding the nation’s highest ideals.

To foster a truly meritocratic society, it is imperative that every citizen has unimpeded access to educational resources and opportunities, regardless of their socioeconomic background. Universal Education Initiative: The Royal Department of Education shall implement comprehensive programs ensuring free access to education from kindergarten through to a Bachelor’s degree for all citizens. This initiative will lay down an equitable foundation, enabling individuals from diverse backgrounds to aspire towards academic excellence and potentially noble status. Scholarship Programs: Recognizing that postgraduate studies are often a barrier due to financial constraints, robust scholarship programs sponsored by both government incentives and private sector partnerships will be established. These scholarships will target Master’s and Doctoral degrees across various fields, with particular attention given each year to emerging disciplines critical for national development. Outreach and Support Systems: Specialized outreach programs aimed at historically underrepresented communities will be developed to encourage participation in higher education. Mentorship schemes, tutoring services, career guidance workshops, and psychological support systems are integral components designed not only as recruitment tools but also as retention strategies once students embark on their academic journeys.

Continuous Learning Mandate: Nobles must engage in lifelong learning practices which may include research endeavors, publication requirements or active participation in scholarly discourse beyond their formal education years—ensuring they remain at the forefront of their respective fields. Community Engagement Criterion: A measure of one’s contribution extends into how knowledge is disseminated among non-academic circles; thus nobles are expected actively participate in public lectureships or community-based educational projects which bridge academia with everyday life experiences. Intergenerational Knowledge Transfer: Noble dynasties must demonstrate sustained excellence over generations—not simply through hereditary titles but via nurturing successive generations who independently meet rigorous academic standards set forth by the Commission on Higher Education, Statistics, and Elections (CHESE). Academic Aristocracy seeks not only to cultivate leaders equipped with advanced degrees but to also engender an environment where every citizen can realistically attain such heights if they so choose with minimal barriers related to wealth or privilege.

Global Competitiveness Audit The pursuit of academic excellence is a cornerstone of the Academic Aristocracy, and it necessitates an unwavering commitment to global competitiveness. To ensure that our institutions remain at the forefront of intellectual advancement, we have instituted a rigorous audit and accreditation process. Each year, universities are subjected to a comprehensive evaluation against international standards. This assessment encompasses various metrics including research output, teaching quality, innovation capabilities, and societal impact. The Commission on Higher Education, Statistics, and Elections oversees this process with unyielding transparency; every facet of the audit is made accessible to the public. Universities that meet or exceed these stringent criteria are awarded “Audited and Accredited” status—a mark of distinction that signifies their contribution to fostering an environment where future nobility can thrive academically. It’s imperative for these institutions not only to maintain but also enhance their standing in the global arena through continuous improvement and adaptation in response to evolving educational paradigms.

Independent Operations Protocols In times when governmental functions face disruption or emergencies arise—be they political impasses or natural calamities—the resilience of our governance system is tested. It is during such critical junctures that our independent commissions demonstrate their utmost importance by maintaining operational continuity. Structured akin to the Supreme Court with 1 Chief Commissioner and 14 Associate Commissioners each—nominated by executive powers yet confirmed legislatively—the four commissions (Higher Education; Human Rights; Religious Freedom; Free Speech) stand as pillars upholding fundamental values irrespective of prevailing circumstances. These bodies operate autonomously from legislative whims or executive pressures ensuring uninterrupted vigilance over their respective domains: safeguarding human rights, preserving religious freedom, protecting free speech principles while simultaneously promoting academic integrity across all levels of education. Their protocols allow them not only survival but effective functioning even amidst government shutdowns—ensuring no lapse occurs in defending constitutional guarantees nor any pause in advancing scholarly pursuits within society.

These commissions are designed to operate autonomously from the three primary branches of government—executive, legislative, and judicial—to provide checks and balances within this new system. Each commission shares a common structural framework that mirrors the composition of the Supreme Court within the Judicial Branch. This structure comprises: One Chief Commissioner Fourteen Associate Commissioners These commissioners are nominated by members of the Executive Branch and must be confirmed by representatives from both chambers of the Legislative Branch—the High Houses' Chamber and Commons' Hall—ensuring bipartisan support for their appointments. Commissioners serve until they reach mandatory retirement age or voluntarily step down, providing continuity and stability within each body’s operations. Their independence is further safeguarded through stringent selection criteria tailored to each commission’s specific focus area; these criteria ensure that only individuals with proven expertise, impartiality, and dedication to public service can assume these critical roles. While sharing a unified structure conducive to robust governance practices across all bodies, each commission has distinct responsibilities reflecting its unique mandate: The Commission on Higher Education, Statistics, and Elections Oversees academic standards for universities seeking accreditation. Ensures inclusivity in academia by prioritizing diversity during university audits. Manages election processes for Noble Dynasties as well as Common Citizenry representation. The Commission on Human Rights Monitors adherence to human rights principles throughout all levels of government. Investigates allegations of human rights abuses within any branch or office. Promotes education about human rights among citizens to foster an informed electorate. The Commission on Religious Freedom Safeguards freedom of religion as enshrined in the constitution. Addresses grievances related to religious discrimination or persecution. Facilitates interfaith dialogue aimed at promoting societal harmony. The Commission on Free Speech Protects freedoms pertaining to speech and press against encroachment by governmental entities or private sectors influenced by noble patronage systems. Enforces transparency laws such as Freedom of Information acts, allowing public access to government records where permissible under privacy considerations. Defends journalists’ right to report without fear of retribution while maintaining ethical journalistic standards. In situations where other parts of the government might stop working because of disagreements or emergencies like natural disasters or economic problems, these Commissions are mandated to keep doing their jobs without stopping. This ensures that there is always someone watching over things and keeping everything in check.

The following outlines specific tax incentives associated with each tier of patronage: Monarch’s Patronage: Companies that receive the Monarch’s Patronage are entitled to a 60% tax benefit. This prestigious endorsement is granted by the reigning King or Queen and signifies the highest level of commendation for a company’s contribution to society. The royal seal must be prominently displayed at all business locations, symbolizing their esteemed status under royal favor. High House’s Patronage: A High House may extend its patronage to a chosen company, conferring upon it a 30% tax benefit. Such an alliance reflects not only economic support but also an intellectual partnership, as these companies often engage in endeavors that resonate with the house’s scholarly pursuits. As part of this agreement, companies are required to exhibit the High House’s seal within their establishments. Minor House’s Patronage: Minor Houses have the opportunity to offer their backing through patronages that provide a 10% tax advantage. While smaller in scale compared to higher echelons, these endorsements still carry weight and can significantly impact local economies and innovation sectors. Displaying the Minor House’s seal is mandatory for recipients of this level of patronage. Additional Provisions: Each Noble Dynasty may grant official patronage exclusively to one company per fiscal year; such arrangements cannot be altered until completion of said term. There are no additional obligations imposed on companies beyond displaying seals; however, they must meet criteria regarding incorporation within national boundaries and employment demographics—specifically ensuring three-quarters domestic workforce residency. These guidelines aim not only at fostering economic growth but also at reinforcing academia-industry collaboration towards sustainable development aligned with intellectual leadership principles inherent in Academic Aristocracy governance.

It requires meticulous planning, widespread education, and societal buy-in to ensure its successful implementation. The following steps outline the necessary measures for transitioning from a democratic society to one governed by intellectual leadership. Constitutional Amendments: Drafting and ratification of constitutional amendments are essential to legitimize the new form of government. These amendments will define the roles of Noble Dynasties, establish commissions, and set forth guidelines for academic qualifications as prerequisites for political participation. Establishment of Commissions: Create independent bodies such as The Commission on Higher Education, Statistics, and Elections; The Commission on Human Rights; The Commission on Religious Freedom; and The Commission on Free Speech. Each commission will have clearly defined roles that align with maintaining checks and balances within this new system. Public Education Campaign: Launch comprehensive educational programs aimed at informing citizens about the principles behind Academic Aristocracy. Use various media platforms to disseminate information regarding changes in voting rights, noble titles' significance, legislative processes under the new regime, etc. Accessibility Initiatives: Implement policies ensuring free access to K-12 education followed by subsidized higher education up to Bachelor’s Degree level. Introduce scholarships incentivized through tax benefits for Master’s and Doctoral studies across diverse fields. Retroactive Accreditation: Award “Audited and Accredited” status retroactively where appropriate so existing institutions can be integrated into this framework without disruption. This step also allows current academically qualified individuals within traditional politics or other sectors to transition smoothly into positions within Noble Houses if they meet criteria. Inclusivity Protocols: Develop stringent inclusivity protocols ensuring that academia does not become an exclusive domain but remains accessible regardless of socioeconomic background. Prioritize diversity in scholarship awards each year based on emerging needs in various fields of study. Global Standards Alignment: Align university accreditation standards with global benchmarks while maintaining transparency during audits. Ensure public accessibility to audit results fostering trust in academic institutions’ contributions towards nobility credentials. Transitional Government Structure: Establish interim governing structures that maintain order while facilitating gradual power transfer according to newly ratified constitutional provisions. Set timelines for elections under new rules, which allows ample time for candidates' verification against established academic criteria. Legal Framework Adjustments: Revise existing laws where necessary, including those related electoral conduct, civil service eligibility, taxation pertaining Royal Patronage System etc., aligning them with the tenets of Academic Aristocracy. Monitoring \u0026 Evaluation Mechanisms: Put in place robust monitoring evaluation mechanisms to track the progress and challenges faced during transitional phase. Regularly assess the effectiveness of initiatives and adjust course as needed to ensure smooth establishment of a stable governance model. By adhering to these carefully considered steps, we pave the way towards an enlightened era where knowledge and wisdom reign as the supreme guiding forces in society’s evolution. It is imperative that all stakeholders—from educators, to policymakers, to ordinary citizens—collaborate closely to make this vision a reality so that future generations may benefit from a just and equitable rule led by the best and brightest minds the nation has to offer.

Conclusion In this manifesto, we have outlined a bold vision for governance that seeks to elevate intellectual leadership and academic excellence as the cornerstones of societal progress. The proposed system of Academic Aristocracy is not merely an alternative structure; it is a transformative approach designed to harness the collective wisdom and expertise of our most educated citizens. We have delineated a government framework where meritocratic principles guide the formation of Noble Dynasties, ensuring that those who lead are not only well-versed in their respective fields but also committed to upholding rigorous standards across generations. By intertwining noble status with scholarly achievement, we aim to create an aristocracy rooted in knowledge rather than inherited privilege or popularity. The dual representation within our Legislative Branch offers balanced governance—combining the insights of High Houses with the perspectives from Commons' Hall—to foster legislation that reflects both expert opinion and public sentiment. Our Executive Branch stands as a testament to sustained academic distinction, while our Judicial Branch remains steadfast in its impartiality and dedication to justice. Our commitment extends beyond establishing an elite ruling class; inclusivity in academia is paramount. We advocate for equal access to education at all levels, ensuring that every citizen has the opportunity to contribute meaningfully to society’s advancement and potentially ascend into nobility based on merit.

On almost every article I write here, I always add a disclaimer at the very end saying that AI was only used to enhance what I thought of and what I wrote. I’m not a native English speaker, so I have to rely on tools to make sure that the message I write is as clear and readable as possible. This article however, is the opposite. I made OpenAI’s GPT-4-Turbo write the entire article, then used follow-up prompts to adjust various parts of it. I thought of the initial prompt (although I wouldn’t be surprised if someone else have already explored it), but the rest is from an AI. Can artificial intelligence tap into the wellspring of human humor to craft articles that tickle our funny bones, or is it bound by its algorithms to a life less laughed? How might AI navigate the nuances of wit and satire to deliver punchlines that resonate with our uniquely human sense of mirth?

It’s only about 1000 words, double that counting the adjustments I tried to make, yet the final paragraph is clearly the model hallucinating. It kindof makes sense, but I think even our best and largest LLMs still has ways to go in terms of humor. Once upon a time in a land not so far away, parents quivered at the thought of having ‘the talk’ with their younglings. In an attempt to soften the blow of biological reality, they turned to Mother Nature’s playbook and spun a tale as old as time itself—the story of the birds and the bees. But let’s be honest here; if we’re aiming for educational accuracy rather than awkward euphemisms, this narrative is about as useful as wings on a worm. First off, let’s chirp into what might just be one of ornithology’s worst PR moves—birds. Yes, our feathered friends do engage in some form of courtship that could rival any soap opera for drama and intrigue. However, when it comes down to brass tacks (or should we say feathers?), birds lay eggs. Last I checked—and trust me on this one—humans don’t pop out shell-encased offspring after a romantic rendezvous. And then there are bees—a hive society where speed dating takes on new heights (quite literally). The queen bee has her pick from an array of dashing drones whose sole purpose in life is to woo her majesty… once. That’s right; these buzzing bachelors have exactly one shot at love before meeting their untimely demise post-coital bliss—a concept that would send shivers down any human suitor’s spine. But wait! There’s more! Let us not forget about flowers—the botanical bedfellows who rely on third-party pollinators like bees or wind to get frisky by proxy. If humans took cues from plants’ reproductive strategies, we’d live in fear that someone sneezing nearby might inadvertently fertilize half the neighborhood—an image straight out of some pollen-fueled dystopian nightmare à la “The Handmaid’s Tale.” So why do well-meaning adults insist on using such wildly inaccurate analogies? Perhaps it stems from discomfort or maybe even nostalgia for simpler times when storks delivered babies wrapped in blankets directly to your doorstep (another myth ripe for debunking but let’s save that fable flaying for another day). Let us dissect further how each element fails spectacularly at preparing young adults for real-world romance: Birds: With their elaborate mating dances and melodious serenades designed to attract mates—not unlike Friday night karaoke—they seem like decent role models until you remember they’re oviparous creatures with cloacas instead of mammalian reproductive systems.

The protective instinct we feel over our creations is natural, but it can also become a hindrance if not managed properly. When I was still a programmer, I remember the sense of ownership that came with every function, class, or module I wrote. It was a piece of me, a testament to my problem-solving skills and hard work. This attachment often led to spirited defenses during code reviews, where I would argue for the merits of my approach, sometimes overlooking the broader picture of what the team was trying to achieve. It wasn’t just about the quality or efficiency of the code; it was personal. Transitioning into the role of a Product Owner, my perspective shifted. I began to see the bigger picture, understanding that each line of code, no matter how elegantly written or cleverly executed, is part of a larger system designed to serve a purpose beyond individual achievement. It became clear that emotional attachment to code could lead to resistance against necessary changes, impacting productivity and stifling innovation. In Agile environments, where adaptability and collaboration are key, such attachments can be particularly problematic. They can create bottlenecks, reduce the willingness to refactor or delete code, and ultimately slow down the iterative process that drives improvement. When developers hold onto their code too tightly, they may miss opportunities to learn from others and to enhance the overall quality of the application. To address this challenge, I have found it essential to foster a culture where detachment from individual contributions is encouraged without diminishing the value of each team member’s work. One effective strategy has been to emphasize the collective ownership of the codebase. By shifting the focus from individual authorship to team responsibility, developers begin to see their work as a contribution to a group effort rather than a standalone masterpiece. The IKEA effect, a term coined from the Swedish furniture giant known for its ready-to-assemble products, encapsulates a psychological phenomenon that extends far beyond the realm of flat-pack tables and bookcases. It speaks to a fundamental aspect of human nature: the value we assign to our own labor and the creations that result from it. At its core, the IKEA effect is about investment and perceived value. When individuals invest effort into creating something, they tend to value the end product more highly than if they had not put in any work at all. This cognitive bias isn’t limited to physical objects; it applies equally to the intangible, such as the code written by software developers. In the context of software development, the IKEA effect can be observed when developers spend hours, days, or even weeks crafting a piece of code. The process involves problem-solving, creativity, and a series of decisions that reflect the developer’s unique approach and understanding. Each line of code becomes infused with the developer’s intellectual labor, making it feel like a personal extension of themselves. This attachment to one’s own work is not inherently negative. It can drive developers to produce high-quality work and take pride in their craftsmanship. However, it also has the potential to cloud judgment, leading to an overestimation of the code’s quality or relevance. In a field where change is constant and adaptation is necessary, this bias can become a barrier to progress. Emotional attachment to code can manifest in various ways within a software development team, often leading to inefficiencies and conflicts that can hinder the progress of a project. When developers become too attached to their code, they may resist necessary changes, advocate for their solutions despite evidence to the contrary, or struggle to accept feedback. This can create friction within teams, as the collaborative nature of so","date":"2023-11-09","objectID":"/crafting-code-not-egos/:0:0","tags":["Product Management","Work"],"title":"14 Strategies for Objectivity in Software Development","uri":"/crafting-code-not-egos/"},{"categories":["Writing"],"content":"Excited to share my latest article, where I delve into the complexities of our democratic systems and draw parallels with challenges in scientific academia.

I am a Filipino citizen currently working as an Product Manager for IT Engineers. While my educational background lies in computer science, not political science, I have always had a deep interest in understanding how our society functions and the intricacies that shape it. I am aware that my perspective on these matters may be different from those who studied them formally. However, I believe that every voice counts when it comes to discussing issues crucial to us all - such as democracy’s failings. It’s with humility that I invite constructive criticism rather than negativity about my opinions on these matters; after all, learning never stops. Democracy has long been touted as ‘the government of the people,’ where power ostensibly rests in citizens' hands through their right to vote for their leaders. In theory, this system aims for equality and fairness by giving everyone a say in how they are governed – but like any other system designed by humans, democracy isn’t perfect. Globally speaking - we’re facing numerous issues within democratic systems ranging from short term limits affecting long-term commitments to rampant misinformation influencing voters' decisions. These problems manifest differently across various regions due to cultural nuances or unique socio-political landscapes. For instance: here in the Philippines, there exists a distinct set of challenges inherent within our democratic structure which mirror global concerns yet also possess uniquely local characteristics. The primary concern revolves around political dynasties dominating elections cycle after cycle due largely because of short term limits coupled with systemic corruption – creating significant hurdles for new blood entering politics \u0026 hindering much-needed progress towards improved governance structures. Beyond geographical borders however lies another problem plaguing democracies worldwide: the issue of uninformed voting. With media’s rise - both traditional and social - politicians now often win not due to their qualifications, but because they’ve successfully managed to reach more voters through sensationalism or misinformation. Interestingly, there’s a parallel between these political issues and problems within scientific academia where researchers are incentivized to overhype their studies for funding – which can compromise the quality of research in pursuit of media coverage. It’s an uncanny mirror image that underscores how far-reaching these issues truly are. In this article, I will delve into each concern in detail: highlighting examples from different countries trying to address them \u0026 offering some thoughts on potential solutions. Together let’s explore why democracy seems failing \u0026 what we could do about it. Term Limits The concept of term limits is ingrained in the democratic system, providing a mechanism to prevent one individual from holding onto power indefinitely. It allows for fresh ideas and perspectives by enabling new leaders to take office regularly. However, this same attribute also poses significant challenges on both global and local scales. ","date":"2023-11-01","objectID":"/reflections-of-a-filipino-it-engineer/:0:0","tags":["Non-fiction","Politics"],"title":"Term Limits, Uninformed Voting \u0026 Sensationalism","uri":"/reflections-of-a-filipino-it-engineer/"},{"categories":["Writing"],"content":"Global Implications On a global scale, short-term limits can impede long-term commitments necessary for addressing pressing issues such as climate change. To understand why let’s first examine how political cycles work in democracies worldwide. Typically, elected officials serve terms ranging between four to six years – during which they are expected not only manage current affairs but also plan \u0026 execute strategies that benefit their constituents in the long run. However, dealing with complex problems like climate change requires time-bound commitment extending beyond typical political cycles; it demands decades-long dedication towards sustainable practices spanning multiple administrations. Moreover, politicians often prioritize policies yielding immediate results over those having delayed benefits due to electoral pressures - thus creating a ‘short-termism’ bias within governance structures globally. For instance: measures aimed at reducing carbon emissions could take several years before visible impacts become apparent – meanwhile elections come \u0026 go every few years forcing leaders to focus more on quick wins rather than investing resources into slow-yielding yet crucial initiatives like environmental conservation or green energy transition. This issue isn’t confined solely within national borders either; international cooperation too gets affected since countries may hesitate making long-term commitments fearing policy reversals by future governments post-elections thereby causing instability in efforts aimed at tackling shared global challenges such as pandemics or environmental degradation.

Short term limits coupled with systemic corruption have created an environment conducive for established families maintaining control over politics cycle after cycle thereby hindering potential new entrants from contesting elections. This phenomenon isn’t unique to the Philippines either; similar patterns are observed across various democracies where powerful elites exploit system loopholes to perpetuate their influence. Such political dynasties often concentrate wealth \u0026 power within a select few - resulting in governance deficits due to lack of competition, innovation or accountability. New blood brings fresh ideas, perspectives and energy necessary for addressing evolving societal challenges – but when politics becomes a ‘family business’, opportunities for such refreshing change get stifled. Moreover, citizens' trust in democratic processes erodes over time as they feel disempowered watching same families ruling repeatedly without substantial improvements in governance quality or living standards. Consequently, public cynicism grows fostering apathy towards participation in democratic practices like voting which further exacerbates systemic issues plaguing these societies. In conclusion: while term limits were designed as safeguards against autocratic tendencies within democracies – ironically they’ve now become tools enabling manipulation by savvy politicians worldwide. The challenge therefore lies not just reforming these systems but also cultivating informed citizenry capable of holding their leaders accountable. Uneducated Voting Democracy, in its ideal form, relies on the informed choice of citizens. However, in reality, numerous factors influence voting behavior – and not all are grounded in rational decision-making. Two critical issues exacerbating this problem include voters favoring popularity over qualifications and manipulation through traditional and social media.

Unfortunately though, elections often resemble popularity contests more than objective evaluations of potential leaders' capabilities. Celebrities or individuals with high public profiles have an inherent advantage due to their widespread recognition regardless of whether they possess requisite skills for governance roles. This trend isn’t confined within specific regions either; from Arnold Schwarzenegger’s governorship in California to Imran Khan’s premiership in Pakistan - we see examples worldwide where fame trumps credentials when it comes to winning elections. Moreover, charismatic personalities can sway public opinion effectively even if they lack substantial policy knowledge or leadership experience thereby underscoring how emotional appeals often override rational judgements during electoral processes.

While this increased accessibility could theoretically promote better informed citizenry - unfortunately it also opens doors for manipulation through misinformation campaigns targeting susceptible demographics. Traditional media outlets like television channels or newspapers have long been accused being biased towards certain political factions thereby influencing public perception subtly yet significantly over time leading up to elections. However recent years saw emergence of a far more insidious threat: fake news spread via social platforms like Facebook or Twitter capable causing immediate large-scale impacts due misinformation spreading rapidly among interconnected users who trust content shared within their networks implicitly without verifying facts independently first. This issue is particularly concerning since studies suggest that false information spreads six times faster than true stories on social media, thereby highlighting the scale of the challenge in combating this phenomenon. Furthermore, technological advancements now enable creation of deepfakes – hyper-realistic doctored videos capable impersonating real individuals convincingly. As these tools become more accessible \u0026 sophisticated, we could potentially face future elections where voters can’t distinguish between real and fabricated content adding further layers of complexity to an already convoluted problem. To summarize: uneducated voting driven by popularity contests or manipulation through media poses serious threats undermining democratic systems globally. Addressing these issues requires not just policy interventions but also societal shifts towards fostering critical thinking skills among citizens while promoting transparency within media operations. A Bleak Parallel in Academia It’s an interesting paradox that the political realm, often criticized for its lack of transparency and accountability, shares striking similarities with the field generally associated with objectivity and rationality: scientific academia. Specifically, within IT Engineering research, this manifests as a pressure to sensationalize findings for securing funding - mirroring issues we’ve discussed earlier regarding popularity over qualifications or manipulation through media in politics.

Given limited resources versus increasing competition among researchers vying for these funds, there exists significant pressure on academics to make their work appear as impactful as possible to secure financial support. Consequently researchers might be incentivized to oversell their findings by focusing more on potential implications rather than core results thereby creating ‘hype’ around their studies even when actual outcomes might not warrant such enthusiasm. While this doesn’t necessarily imply fabrication data; it does however introduce biases within scientific literature since positive results get reported more frequently compared to negative ones leading up skewed understanding about particular fields among both peers and public alike.

Given tech industry’s pace plus massive market opportunities available; companies often invest heavily into R\u0026D initiatives seeking breakthroughs providing them competitive advantages hence making IT Engineering one hotspots witnessing intense competition among researchers chasing after lucrative corporate sponsorships alongside traditional academic grants. This scenario unfortunately fosters an environment conducive for overhyping tech solutions promising revolutionary impacts - even when they might still be at early experimental stages far from practical implementation. For instance: while quantum computing, cryptocurrency and the blockchain or artificial intelligence all holds immense potential reshaping our world; it’s crucial to remember that these technologies are still in their infancy with many challenges yet to overcome before becoming mainstream realities. Such sensationalism could lead towards inflated expectations among investors, policymakers or general public which when unmet eventually result into disillusionment affecting future support for similar initiatives thereby creating a vicious cycle hindering genuine progress within this field. Possible Solutions? Having explored the challenges within democratic systems and their surprising parallels with issues in scientific academia, it’s essential to discuss potential solutions. These are complex problems without easy answers, but by learning from global examples and exploring innovative approaches, we can start moving towards a more robust democracy and a healthier scientific community.

One such solution could be the implementation of longer term limits or staggered terms to ensure policy continuity while still preserving democratic principles. The example of Ireland presents an interesting case study for this approach. In Ireland, the President serves a seven-year term and can be re-elected once, allowing for a maximum leadership period of 14 years. This duration significantly exceeds the typical four-to-six year terms common in many democracies around the world and provides an extended time frame for long-term planning and execution of policies. In parallel with this system, however, is Ireland’s lower house - Dáil Éireann - where members (TDs) serve five-year terms. The shorter tenure here ensures regular infusion of fresh perspectives into governance processes while maintaining checks and balances on presidential powers through their role in legislation approval. This dual structure facilitates a balance between stability and adaptability within Irish politics: On one hand, having a leader with potential access to 14 uninterrupted years allows them to strategize beyond immediate electoral pressures; they can devise initiatives addressing issues like climate change or economic development which require sustained commitment over several years before tangible results materialize. On the other hand, periodic elections at lower parliamentary levels maintain democratic vibrancy by offering citizens regular opportunities to voice their preferences regarding legislative representatives thereby ensuring accountability among these elected officials towards their constituents' evolving needs. Furthermore, should public opinion shift dramatically during any given president’s term due societal changes or unforeseen circumstances – having multiple general elections within that timeframe enables necessary course corrections via alterations in parliament composition reflecting updated voter sentiments more accurately compared if both executive \u0026 legislative branches operated under similar long-term durations hence minimizing risks associated policy stagnation or disconnect from public will over time. For international cooperation on long-term issues like climate change or pandemics, binding treaties with sanctions for early withdrawal might provide stability. The Paris Agreement is an attempt at this approach although its effectiveness remains to be seen given recent high-profile withdrawals.

One such challenge is breaking down work into user stories - a fundamental aspect of any Agile project. User stories are essentially discrete units of work that describe a feature or ability from an end-user perspective. They serve as building blocks for our projects and provide us with a roadmap to follow throughout development cycles. However, creating effective user stories isn’t always straightforward; it requires practice and experience. I remember one particular instance when we were working on developing a new feature for our application. We had brainstormed several ideas and had outlined what we thought was an excellent plan using traditional methods of story creation based on features alone. But as we delved deeper into the development process, we realized that this approach led to long feedback loops and increased complexity due to dependencies between different parts of the system. This experience taught me two important lessons about creating user stories in Agile projects: There is no ‘silver bullet’ solution – The best way to break down work into user stories depends largely on the specific context and requirements of each project. Practice makes perfect – Like many other aspects in life, mastering story creation comes with time and hands-on experience. The popular framework used by most teams involves thinking about who the user is (As a…), what they want (I want…) ,and why they want it (so that…). While this provides us with some direction, it doesn’t necessarily guide us towards breaking down complex tasks into smaller functional pieces effectively. That’s where Bill Wake’s concept of viewing systems like multi-layer cakes comes in handy Bill Wake 2003. Wake suggests that we should think of a system as a multi-layer cake, with each layer representing different aspects such as the network layer, persistence layer, logic layer and presentation layer. When splitting a story, it’s like serving up only part of that cake. The best way to give the customer the essence of the whole cake is to slice vertically through all layers. This approach resonated with me because I had seen firsthand how focusing on one aspect or ‘layer’ at a time could lead to inefficiencies in our workflow. For instance, developing an entire database layer without considering its interaction with other layers often resulted in little value for customers if there was no corresponding presentation layer. Horizontal slicing is a common approach to breaking down work in software development projects. It involves dividing the project into layers or tiers, such as the user interface (UI), business logic, and database layers. Each layer is then developed separately before being integrated to form the complete system. For instance, consider a team developing an e-commerce website. They might decide to first build all of the UI components like product pages, shopping cart functionality, and checkout screens. Once that’s done, they would move on to implementing business logic for inventory management, pricing calculations etc., followed by setting up databases for storing product information and customer details. While this method may seem logical at first glance - after all it allows teams to focus on one aspect of the system at a time - it has several significant drawbacks which can hinder progress and negatively impact overall project outcomes.

This goes against Agile principles which emphasize early and continuous delivery of valuable software in order to maximize customer satisfaction. In our e-commerce website example above, customers wouldn’t be able to interact with any part of site until every single component across all layers was finished – from browsing products right through making purchases. This means potentially waiting months before getting any real-world insights about how well your solution meets their needs or where improvements could be made. Increased Risk: The longer you wait for feedback from end-users or stakeholders, higher risk there is that what you’re building won’t meet their expectations or requirements when finally delivered. In worst case scenarios this could mean having wasted considerable time and resources developing features that need substantial rework or even removal altogether because they don’t align with user needs. With horizontal slicing approach used in our example scenario; if customers find navigation confusing once site launches because product categories weren’t structured as they expected, or if checkout process is too complicated leading to abandoned carts, significant changes would be needed across all layers of system. This could potentially require a lot more effort than if these issues had been identified and addressed earlier in development cycle. Lack Of Flexibility: Horizontal slicing can also make it difficult to adapt project scope or priorities as business needs change. If you’ve already invested heavily into developing one layer of your system, changing course partway through can be costly and time-consuming. For instance, halfway through building our e-commerce site the team might discover that there’s a new market trend for personalized shopping experiences. To capitalize on this opportunity they decide to add recommendation engine functionality which suggests products based on customer’s browsing history and preferences. However because UI was built without considering this feature, substantial modifications would now be required not just at UI level but also within business logic and database layers to support data collection and analysis necessary for generating recommendations. Integration Challenges: When different layers are developed independently from each other integration often becomes complex task fraught with difficulties. Incompatibilities between how different parts of system have been designed can lead to bugs or performance issues that are hard to diagnose and fix. In context of our example; if database structure wasn’t properly aligned with requirements of inventory management logic within business layer – perhaps due lack communication between teams working on these components – then problems may arise when trying integrate them together such as incorrect stock levels being displayed on product pages. Team Silos: Lastly horizontal slicing tends encourage formation silos within teams where individuals or sub-teams become specialized in working only certain aspects project rather than having shared understanding whole system works together deliver value end-users customers. This lack cross-functional collaboration knowledge sharing can hinder problem-solving creativity innovation while also increasing risk key person dependency where loss single team member significantly impacts project’s progress success. To sum up, while horizontal slicing might seem like a logical approach to breaking down work in software development projects, it has several significant drawbacks. It can delay user feedback, increase project risk and complexity, reduce flexibility to adapt to changing business needs or priorities, create integration challenges and encourage the formation of team silos.

Join me in this exploration and let's open up the conversation about the future of work.","date":"2023-08-04","objectID":"/innovation-at-risk/","tags":["AI","Product Management","Work"],"title":"Rethinking Restrictions on AI Tools in the Workplace","uri":"/innovation-at-risk/"},{"categories":["Work"],"content":"It’s a crisp morning as I sit down at my desk, cup of coffee in hand, ready to face the day’s challenges. As a Product Owner, my work is anything but mundane, and every day holds a new set of puzzles to solve. But recently, there’s been a cloud hanging over my morning ritual that I’ve found increasingly difficult to ignore. It’s not an impending deadline or a problematic feature; it’s something much broader, with implications reaching far beyond my projects or even our organization. It’s the restrictions on the use of AI tools in the workplace that have become increasingly prevalent. My concern is not rooted in a resistance to change or an unhealthy attachment to the ways of the ‘good old days’, where we can use cutting edge AI without restriction. Rather, it’s based on the notion that these new rules on AI use, particularly with Large Language Models (LLMs), could inhibit innovation and growth in our rapidly advancing tech industry. These restrictions, while aimed at addressing valid concerns regarding privacy and proprietary data, have the potential to cause more harm than good, inadvertently stunting the creative and innovative capacities of our workforce. For those unfamiliar with the concept, LLMs are AI tools capable of performing a variety of tasks, both technical and non-technical. For us tech folks, these AI tools, like Github Copilot, have been a godsend, removing the necessity of boilerplate code, aiding in code review, and even helping to create context-specific unit tests. Non-technical workers, too, have found immense value in these tools, with applications ranging from automatic data analysis in Excel 365 to generating Minutes of Meetings in video chats. The recent regulations put in place against the use of these tools are undoubtedly grounded in concerns about data privacy and the proprietary nature of the work we do. But I believe there’s a way to navigate these issues without outright restricting access to these game-changing tools, a solution that lies in leveraging the services of AI tool providers who are already sharing data centers with us. Navigating the modern world of technology is a delicate balance. On one hand, we have the promise of innovation and efficiency that AI brings; on the other, there are legitimate concerns about data privacy and the proprietary nature of our work. This balancing act has led to the imposition of restrictions on AI tools in the workplace, a move that, in my opinion, carries unintended risks that might outweigh its benefits. The driving force behind these restrictions is the apprehension about proprietary data being shared with third-party companies who run the LLM models. While this fear is understandable, the solutions that have been proposed – to restrict the use of AI tools altogether – may be throwing the proverbial baby out with the bathwater. One immediate risk that springs to mind is the stifling of creativity and innovation. The tools that have become a part of our daily workflow do more than just automate tasks – they stimulate creative thinking and spur innovation by freeing up time and mental space. By imposing restrictions on their use, we are inadvertently hampering this creativity and curtailing the potential growth that comes with it. A second, perhaps less obvious, risk is the creation of a potential security loophole. With the restrictions in place, experts and engineers who have become accustomed to the convenience and efficiency of these tools may find ways to circumvent these rules. This could involve transferring code or other sensitive material to unmonitored, personal devices to take advantage of the AI tools, before transferring it back into the work environment. Not only does this introduce more risk to our proprietary products, it also puts a strain on our team members, who are now burdened with the task of manually doing work that was previously automated.

I am a deity, a spiritual being, as old as the primal energies that birthed the first stars, and I will remain, undying, even after the last stellar giants have exhausted their light and bowed to the inevitable darkness. But now, my focus converges on a soul entrenched in her own convictions—a non-believer named Sarai. Her existence hums distinctly in the grand tapestry of the universe, a discordant melody that disrupts my divine symphony, yet possesses an undeniable harmony of its own. Sarai—a woman of unyielding resilience, honed by the relentless grindstone of suffering and defiance. Her posture is as rigid as a century-old oak, her gaze as unyielding as hardened obsidian, all directed at me—an enigma she either refuses to understand or is unable to comprehend. She shields her soul within a fortress of disbelief, impervious to divine influence. She stands upon a vast plain, the verdant carpet of grass under her feet swaying like a sea stirred by an unseen force. Beyond her stretches the horizon, a thin line where earth and sky kiss, a testament to the world’s infinite mysteries. The azure canvas overhead is strewn with lazy cotton clouds that amble across the celestial dome, oblivious to the profound confrontation beneath them. Behind her, a solitary tree stands like a silent guardian, its gnarled branches whispering tales of the ages to the winds. “People make their own fate,” she says, the strength of her belief imbuing her words with a biting edge. She spits out the words like poison, each syllable a renunciation of the divine. “We don’t need gods to shape our lives.” I respond, not with thunderous might, but with the subtle rhythms of nature. I am the tremor beneath her feet, a subtle shiver of the earth that rattles her resolute stance. I am the wind’s sigh that toys with the loose strands of her hair, insinuating myself into her guarded space. I am the sun, its harsh but vital glare shining unobstructed onto her upturned face, daring her to deny my existence. “Sarai,” my voice, as timeless as the cosmos, reverberates within her mind. Each syllable echoes in sync with the pulsating rhythm of her heartbeat. “Do you truly believe your fate is yours alone to decide?” A silence descends between us—a profound stillness that stretches into infinity—as the beat of her heart falters momentarily. In this lapse, the seed of doubt sows itself. She remains silent, perhaps mulling over the audacity of my question, or maybe the shock of its resonance within her. For the first time, the fortress of her disbelief shudders. I dive deeper into Sarai’s consciousness, not as an intruder but as a guide, gently nudging her towards a revelation that extends beyond her firmly held beliefs. A divine resonance emanates from me, pulsing through her, vibrating in every particle of her being, rippling across the plain that stretches out around us. “Sarai, consider the world around you. You are a single pebble tossed into a vast lake. Your choices, your actions, they create ripples. Those ripples intersect with others, cascading outwards, far beyond your immediate sight. They echo into the world, the universe even, leaving impressions that last long after your own existence has faded.” She glances around, her dark eyes widening as if taking in the world for the first time. Her gaze roves from the gentle undulation of the grass, each blade dancing to the tune of the wind, to the solitary tree that stands tall, its branches a haven for the avian songsters who add their voices to the grand symphony of existence.

We are the fortunate soothsayers at the forefront of a revolution, witnessing artificial intelligence’s gradual metamorphosis from sci-fi fantasy to reality. Yet, while we revel in the ongoing digital renaissance, it’s impossible to ignore the hurdles that come with it. Let’s embark on a brief journey through the current landscape of AI, focusing particularly on large language models (LLMs) and their workings. AI today is a buzzing beehive of innovation. Everywhere we look, we see LLMs proving their mettle. From composing human-like texts and predicting stock market trends to assisting in medical diagnoses, these intelligent systems are making their presence felt. LLMs learn from vast amounts of data, absorbing patterns, nuances, and knowledge, a process akin to an enthusiastic learner in a gigantic library, reading and internalizing as much as they can. LLMs operate on a simple principle. They’re trained on enormous datasets, extracting valuable information and making sense of it through what we call tokens. Picture tokens as snippets of information, like pieces of a puzzle that the model assembles to gain understanding and provide responses. To make the most of an LLM, one needs to feed it as many tokens as it can handle, pushing the boundaries of its capacity to ensure comprehensive learning. But here’s the snag. We’re constantly pushing the limits of the token count to equip the model with more knowledge, but doing so comes with its fair share of problems. There’s a cap on the number of tokens these models can process effectively, and exceeding this token limit can lead to inaccuracies and ‘hallucinations’ where the model begins to generate content that doesn’t align with reality. More crucially, the conventional approach to training AI models is time-consuming and resource-intensive. The training process requires us to feed proprietary data into the system, which is not only a mammoth task but also raises concerns around data privacy and security. So, are we resigned to these challenges, or is there a path that leads us towards a more efficient, accurate, and secure way of harnessing the power of LLMs? I believe there is, and it involves a fundamental shift in our approach, swapping the model training with a mechanism that allows AI to interact with databases directly. As we venture further, we’ll unpack this new approach, exploring its potential benefits and implications, and why I think it’s a game-changer in the realm of AI. To fully appreciate the transformative potential of the new approach I’m advocating for, it’s necessary to delve a little deeper into the issues faced with the conventional methods of training AI models. Our current approach to machine learning models hinges heavily on training. We teach models to learn and reason by exposing them to vast volumes of data, allowing them to understand patterns, context, and relationships. This training phase is crucial, determining the model’s eventual accuracy and its ability to handle complex tasks. However, the size of the training data and the time and computational power required for effective learning can make this process a formidable undertaking. Besides, the need to constantly update the training data to ensure the model remains relevant adds to the complexity. There’s also the question of the proprietary nature of data and the stringent need to adhere to data privacy norms. Then, we have the token limit problem, the invisible boundary that prevents us from stuffing our models with as much knowledge as we’d like. Each token a model processes eats into its total capacity, and exceeding this limit can lead to a degradation in the quality of the model’s responses. With these challenges at hand, what if we could pivot to a different strategy? One where we don’t have to worry about the token limit or go through the painstaking process of training the model on proprietary data?

This rings particularly true for my journey from a hands-on DotNet and DevOps engineer to Product Management, navigating the agile landscape with its emphasis on continuous integration, feedback loops, and quick iteration. The compass guiding me through this voyage has been a principle I’ve come to respect and cherish - Intellectual Humility. The transition from an engineer to product management brought with it a new perspective, a shift from hands-on problem-solving to strategic planning and team guidance. At first, my instinct was to lean on my technical knowledge, anticipating issues and guiding the team’s technical direction. However, I quickly recognized the potential and diversity each member of our team brought to the table. Their unique skills and ideas painted a broader, more vibrant picture. The cornerstone of Intellectual Humility, in my experience, is understanding that our knowledge has its limitations. It’s about being receptive to new insights and feedback, recognizing that it’s okay to not have all the answers. My role as a leader wasn’t to dictate solutions but to trust my team’s expertise, allowing them the freedom to innovate, explore, and bring their own insights to the forefront. Creating a culture of open dialogue and transparency has been an integral part of my journey in product management. Encouraging feedback from my team has not only broadened my perspective but also fostered a sense of mutual respect and collaboration. This practice wasn’t about minimizing my own skills or experiences, but about nurturing an environment that celebrates collective intelligence, where learning is a shared journey. Nevertheless, the principle of Intellectual Humility must walk hand in hand with a “trust but verify” approach. This balance became glaringly evident during a difficult incident. A misunderstanding led to some miscommunication about a feature that was believed to be blocked due to an external dependency. The reality, however, was that we were inadvertently causing the delay. This episode served as a gentle reminder that while trust is the foundation of any team, oversight is equally essential. Trusting in my team’s abilities or intentions did not have to mean complete abandonment of checks and verification. It was a lesson in understanding that accountability and trust are two sides of the same coin, mutually reinforcing to foster a transparent and reliable work environment. Applying Intellectual Humility, combined with the principle of “trust but verify”, has been a learning experience, shaping my approach to tackling challenges. I share these reflections not as an authority on the subject, but as a fellow traveler on the path of continuous growth and learning. Embracing Intellectual Humility and verifying as necessary isn’t about doubting your team’s capabilities. Instead, it is about nurturing a shared sense of accountability. For those navigating the ever-changing waters of Agile IT environments, I invite you to try this approach. Allow your team the space to surprise you with their skills and ideas, trust them, but also remember to verify. It’s not a sign of mistrust but a pillar of shared accountability that can lead us to learn, grow, and become more effective in our roles. In a technical context, Intellectual Humility manifests as an understanding that technology and its applications are ever-evolving landscapes. The solutions and techniques that were deemed best today might be overshadowed by more innovative, effective methodologies tomorrow. This acknowledgment has a direct influence on how we approach problem-solving. It encourages us to stay curious, open to new learning, and readily adaptable to emerging technologies and practices.

As a product owner, you’re the conductor of a complex symphony of ideas, resources, and time constraints, all revolving around one ultimate goal: delivering value to your end users. The key to achieving this lies not only in understanding what to deliver, but also in determining the order in which to deliver it. This is where the art and science of prioritization comes into play. Prioritization, in the context of agile development, is a critical practice that helps teams decide where to focus their limited resources to maximize the value delivered to the customer. This practice isn’t without its challenges. As product owners, we’re often faced with a deluge of features, bugs, enhancements, and technical debt, all competing for attention. The question that frequently arises is, “How do we choose what to work on first?” It’s a question that’s simple to ask, but complex to answer. There are a multitude of prioritization methods available—each with its unique approach and focus. From the Kano Model and Opportunity Scoring, which place a premium on user feedback, to the MoSCoW Model and Priority Poker, which emphasize stakeholder input, to methods like the Cost of Delay and Stack Ranking, which revolve around financial implications and feature comparison respectively. The key to effective prioritization lies in understanding these methods and knowing when to apply each one. Through the course of this article, I will delve into the nuances of these prioritization methods, focusing on the circumstances that might influence the choice of one over the other. My goal is to empower you, fellow product owners, with a deeper understanding of how to navigate these methods to deliver the most value to your customers and stakeholders. We’ve all been there. We have this goldmine of user feedback - a mix of praises, criticisms, and suggestions - and we’re stumped on how to use it to our advantage. When user feedback is crucial, a couple of methods stand out as particularly useful: the Kano Model and Opportunity Scoring. Let’s start with the Kano Model. It’s like a sorting hat for your feedback, neatly classifying them into must-haves, nice-to-haves, and delighters. These categories give you a clear understanding of what your users see as essential, what they see as bonuses, and what would truly impress them. It’s a great way to make sense of a flood of feedback and turn it into an actionable plan. The best part is, it gives you a visual representation of what needs to be prioritized. And who doesn’t love a good visual aid? It’s simple, it’s clear, and it’s a great way to get everyone on the same page about what matters most to your users. On the other hand, we have Opportunity Scoring. This method takes things a step further. It doesn’t just sort feedback; it anticipates it. It takes your user research data and, like a crystal ball, shows you what your users are likely to expect from your product. It’s a great way to get a step ahead of your users and shape your schedule to meet their expectations before they even voice them out. It ensures you’re investing your resources wisely, focusing on what your users will find valuable rather than what might just be a waste of time. So, when user feedback is crucial to your decision-making process, remember the Kano Model and Opportunity Scoring. One helps you sort and prioritize feedback, and the other helps you anticipate and meet user expectations. Both will ensure your product development is driven by what your users really want and need. There are times when the decision-making power rests predominantly within the organization. It’s when the stakeholders in your company have the final say. In this scenario, the methods that come to the fore are Priority Poker, the $100 Test, and the MoSCoW Model.

This wisdom comes not just from personal experience, but also from a very enlightening stakeholder management training I undertook. In an agile environment, change is the only constant. Priorities shift, requirements evolve, and teams adapt accordingly. Amid this flux, stakeholders play a pivotal role. They not only bring in resources and expertise but also guide the product’s direction through their unique insights and feedback. Therefore, effective stakeholder management is key to navigating these ever-shifting sands. Product owners, in particular, juggle a variety of responsibilities, one of which is the regular communication with diverse stakeholders. Each of these individuals or groups has their own interests, concerns, and expectations regarding the product. Understanding and managing these different needs and perspectives is critical for the smooth execution of the project. With the right stakeholder management skills, product owners can foster more open communication, drive consensus more efficiently, and respond to changes more effectively. These skills also help mitigate potential conflicts, facilitate better decision-making, and ultimately, lead to a more successful product. Each stakeholder brings unique perspectives, strengths, and challenges to a project. In my training, I learned the importance of recognizing these differences - much like a zookeeper understands the unique needs and behaviors of various animals in their care. Just as a zookeeper interacts differently with a panther, peacock, dolphin, or owl, a product owner must tailor their communication and management strategies to suit each stakeholder. This is the “animal profiles” approach. It enhances communication, reduces conflict, and improves project outcomes. Drawing from my training and experience, I want to delve into these animal profiles, explore real-world scenarios, and propose effective engagement strategies for each stakeholder type. One useful approach I learned during my stakeholder management training is categorizing stakeholders into four distinct profiles, akin to different animal species: Panthers, Peacocks, Dolphins, and Owls. Each of these ‘animal profiles’ represents a different set of behaviors, tendencies, and communication styles. Panthers are aggressive and fast-moving. They are often competitive, making others tense but driving progress rapidly. Peacocks are social, colorful, and creative. They can be dramatic and enjoy being the center of attention, often bringing a spark of energy and innovation. Dolphins are friendly and empathetic, often serving as peacemakers. They are team players, fostering unity and collaboration. Owls are detail-focused, clear, and logical. They are patient and wise, preferring to take their time to ensure precision and accuracy. Remember, these are just guidelines. Stakeholders may not neatly fit into one category, or they may exhibit traits from multiple profiles. Additionally, a stakeholder’s profile can change over time, depending on various factors like the context of the project, their personal circumstances, and more.

Each stakeholder, akin to a unique species, has their own characteristics and needs. As product owners in an agile environment, our role is not only to understand these differences but also to adapt our communication and management strategies accordingly. Through the “animal profiles” approach - Panthers, Peacocks, Dolphins, and Owls - we can gain valuable insights into stakeholders' behavior and tendencies. This allows us to engage with them more effectively, leading to better communication, less conflict, and improved project outcomes. It’s important to remember, however, that these profiles are not rigid categories, but rather flexible guidelines. People are complex and can exhibit characteristics from multiple profiles or change over time. Moreover, the goal is not to label stakeholders but to better understand their perspectives and create a productive work environment. Our focus should be on fostering mutual respect, open communication, and collaboration in our diverse stakeholder ecosystem. Ultimately, effective stakeholder management is about nurturing relationships and steering your team towards shared goals. And while it may be challenging, it’s certainly a rewarding journey, leading us to successful products that truly meet our users' needs. Note: This was first published as a LinkedIn article.

One day, I’m watching a cat video, and the next, I’m getting a philosophy lesson from John Searle about his Chinese Room Argument. Now, I don’t work with AI or anything, but as someone involved in tech, it got me thinking – have we moved past this Chinese Room thing with the latest AI advancements? It’s an intriguing question and well, here I am, exploring this curiosity and writing about it. Who knew a TikTok video could lead to such a deep dive, right? The philosophical underpinnings of artificial intelligence (AI) have long been a subject of profound debate. One argument, presented by philosopher John Searle, has managed to encapsulate a particular line of inquiry regarding AI’s ability (or inability) to comprehend. Known as the Chinese Room argument, this thought experiment has influenced AI theory since its inception. In 1980, Searle posed a hypothesis challenging the premise that machines can possess ‘understanding’ in the same sense as human beings do. His Chinese Room scenario paints a vivid picture: imagine a non-Chinese speaking person situated in a room. This individual is provided with an elaborate set of instructions, a “rule book” of sorts, which allows them to translate incoming Chinese characters into outgoing characters. To anyone outside the room, it would appear as if the operator inside truly comprehends Chinese, as they process and produce sensible Chinese phrases. However, in truth, the operator does not understand the language. They are merely following the rules set out before them, translating symbols according to an established guide without comprehension of the language’s meaning or syntax. Searle proposed this scenario as an analog to AI, suggesting that AI, much like the individual in the Chinese Room, may mimic human-like responses without possessing an iota of genuine understanding. Searle’s Chinese Room argument fundamentally challenges the concept of Strong AI, or the belief that machines can genuinely understand and exhibit human-like intelligence. The argument has been considered an intellectual bulwark against the notion of truly cognitive machines, asserting that while machines may simulate understanding, this is an illusion. They are, according to Searle, devoid of consciousness, mind, and understanding, trapped eternally within their Chinese Room. The AI landscape has undergone seismic shifts since John Searle first introduced the Chinese Room Argument. Among the most significant advancements in AI theory and practice is the emergence of Large Language Models (LLM), such as OpenAI’s GPT-3 \u0026 GPT-4, Google’s Bard (LaMDA, PaLM), and Meta’s LLaMA. These advanced AI systems have brought forth new ways of understanding how machines can learn, adapt, and even potentially understand, challenging long-standing assumptions. In the earlier days of AI, machines were rule-based, operating within predefined parameters. They were confined to following specific instructions, much like the operator in Searle’s Chinese Room. However, the advent of LLMs marked a notable departure from these traditional rule-based systems. Powered by complex neural networks, these models mimic the human brain’s learning processes in ways never before seen in AI. These AI models are trained on vast databases of human language, encompassing a broad spectrum of topics, contexts, and nuances. Through deep learning, they are capable of recognizing patterns, discerning relationships, and making predictions based on the data they’ve been trained on. Their operation extends beyond mere rule-following; they demonstrate a form of learning akin to human cognitive processes. Furthermore, these LLM-based AIs have made some remarkable strides, demonstrating capabilities that edge closer to a human-like understanding of information. In 2020, OpenAI’s GPT-3 generated human-like text, seemingly understanding and producing language beyond simple rule-following.

Do you agree with my choices?

My daughter, currently a lively toddler of 27 months, is at the beginning of her lifelong journey of learning. I often find myself contemplating the skills and values I’d like to instill in her, especially as she prepares to step into the educational arena in a couple of years. From personal experiences and reflections, I’ve identified three critical areas that I believe will shape her into a strong, independent thinker, capable of carving her path in any STEM field - a sector I hope she’ll find her passion in. These aren’t just academic skills; they’re life skills. They’re about understanding, questioning, communicating, and creating. Over the course of this article, I’ll be delving into each of these areas: learning to be a ‘Good Student’, the art of effective note-taking, and the pivotal role of mathematics. I invite you to join me on this exploration, whether you’re a parent, educator, or just someone interested in the lifelong journey of learning. In a world where information comes at us from every direction, it’s crucial to foster a discerning mindset from an early age. This is the first and perhaps the most crucial lesson I want to impart to my daughter: how to be a ‘Good Student’. This term goes beyond conventional definitions - it’s not just about acing exams or pleasing teachers. Instead, it’s about creating a balance between understanding the curriculum and retaining her individuality and personal beliefs. One of the most challenging aspects of learning, especially in a traditional classroom setting, is distinguishing between what is being taught and what she believes. Just because an authority figure, like a teacher, imparts a piece of information, it doesn’t automatically make it an absolute truth. However, being a ‘Good Student’ in this context requires a delicate dance. She should be able to demonstrate understanding of the material, to satisfy the teacher’s expectations, without letting it override her personal belief system. Let’s take an example. Suppose she’s in a history class, learning about a controversial event. The teacher, influenced by their background, may present a version of the event that leans towards a particular viewpoint. As a ‘Good Student’, my daughter should acknowledge this perspective, take it into account, but also understand that there might be other perspectives out there. She might need to agree in class, to meet the educational expectations, but she should also be motivated to explore other perspectives independently. In essence, my daughter should be acutely aware when she is embodying the role of a ‘Good Student’. This means reiterating what the teacher believes or wants her to believe without letting it affect her own perspective. It’s a skill that not only applies to her future classroom but in many aspects of life where she’ll need to navigate differing viewpoints. This capacity to discern, question, and remain open-minded will be the cornerstone of her intellectual growth. It will help her form her unique perspectives, build her resilience in the face of differing opinions, and enhance her ability to communicate her ideas effectively. It’s not about breeding dissent, but fostering a mindset that values curiosity and critical thinking. In the digital age, where we have almost unlimited access to information, knowing how to organize, retain, and recall that information becomes a vital skill. This brings me to the second lesson I wish to impart to my daughter - the art of effective note-taking. At first glance, note-taking might seem like a mundane task, but its importance cannot be overstated. It’s not just about jotting down what is being said or discussed. Rather, it’s an active process of making sense of the information, synthesizing it, and creating a personalized knowledge database that she can return to and build upon. Note-taking begins in the classroom.

First and foremost, I am also a member of the Millennial generation. Specifically, I’m an “elder millennial,” to borrow a phrase from Iliza Shlesinger. This is not an attempt to start a fight or stir up controversy; rather, it is a personal account of a problem I faced and how I overcame it. When I was still a software engineer, I encountered numerous bugs, issues, and impediments. When I inevitably run into one, I have learned from my more experienced coworkers to find an expert right away who can help me solve the problem at hand. Alternatively, if I am unable to identify an expert in a specific area, I have also learned that reaching out to my Product Owner is very beneficial. POs are well-connected with stakeholders who possess the necessary skills and knowledge to help me overcome obstacles. By closely working with POs, I can leverage their network and identify the appropriate person who can offer me the necessary guidance and expertise. Now that I’m the Product Owner in charge of a team of engineers' backlog, I’ve noticed a few things. First, all of my engineers are younger millennials, and second, the issues that they are dealing with are a lot more complex than what I had encountered before. I thought it was just an experience or training gap, but as we worked together more, I saw that I was lucky to have brilliant engineers on my team. However, when they bring up issues during our stand ups and retrospectives, it’s always a lot more complicated than what I was expecting. During one of our meetings, I finally realized what the difference was when one of our engineers explained an issue to me. After they told me what was going on, but before I was able to get a word in to clarify something, the engineer started listing the solutions that they had tried to solve the problem. Each of these solutions had specific drawbacks and a well-considered explanation for why it wouldn’t solve our initial problem. I expected them to try to solve problems before requesting assistance, but not like this. Looking back at our previous impediments, it appears that almost always, a younger millennial will opt to try each solution out and explore the problem space before asking for help. It seems as though they would always opt to prepare beforehand because they expect to be questioned about why they did not do this or that before reaching out for support. At first, this may sound good. Why wouldn’t an engineer try to figure things out before seeking assistance? However, the end result is typically a worker who never asks for help. In the rare cases when they do ask for support, their question is incredibly nuanced and difficult to solve. Even in the cases where they didn’t ask for help, they may have spent more time and effort exploring the problem space than simply sending a message to a domain expert. This situation can cause a lot of frustration and confusion in the workplace as the engineer spends hours trying to figure out a problem that could have been solved in a few minutes by simply asking someone else. When I realized the difference between my working style and that of my younger colleagues, I confided with a mentor and asked if they had seen this behavior before. We learned that colleagues from the generation before us, or those who worked primarily with the last generation, have encountered similar issues with the upcoming millennial generation. We kept talking about this problem, and when we brought in more coworkers and some younger engineers, we came up with a solution. We should look at a problem (bug, issue, impediment, etc.) as if it were a tree, and its solutions would be its stems and leaves. Younger millennials tend to look at the whole tree, going through the “stems” or solutions that they can see. When they finally ask for help, they will list the problems they have run into whil","date":"2023-02-28","objectID":"/generational-shift-in-solving-issues/:0:0","tags":["Product Management","Work","Millenial"],"title":"A Generational Shift in Solving Issues","uri":"/generational-shift-in-solving-issues/"},{"categories":["Work"],"content":"The issue for DevOps and Product Management is the same: How can we create the smallest possible change with the greatest potential impact?","date":"2023-01-24","objectID":"/devops-and-product-mgmt/","tags":["DevOps","Product Management","Work"],"title":"What I Learned From DevOps, Applied to Product Management","uri":"/devops-and-product-mgmt/"},{"categories":["Work"],"content":"It has been several enlightening months since I transitioned from a DevOps Engineering role to being a Product Owner. I have learned a lot from my colleagues who have been in the role for years, but there are also certain aspects that have been unique to my experience, such as the use of agile principles and applying DevOps principles to product management. As the owner of a product, most of the value you provide comes from pushing the features of your product forward. This requires understanding what the customer wants, how the product needs to be built and deployed, and ensuring that there is a plan to deliver on time. This is where I first noticed the overlap between the principles of DevOps and those of product management. At the heart of both disciplines is the idea that small changes can have a big impact on the success of an organization or product. The issue for both is the same: How can we create the smallest possible change with the greatest potential impact? By applying DevOps-style continuous integration (CI) during product development, product managers are able to identify areas for improvement faster and more accurately, as well as quickly deploy changes with minimal disruption. One of the ways that this can be done is by dramatically reducing the size of features before implementation. Teams can then test various iterations quickly and effectively before moving forward. Additionally, DevOps' continuous feedback loops make sure that problems are found and fixed right away. The same principle applies to product management: understanding user needs through feedback loops and weekly catchup meetings helps us make better decisions about what we’re building and how we’re building it. Inter-team collaboration is another area that DevOps (and being Agile in general) emphasize. Product managers should take this same approach in order to realize their product vision. Working with everyone from different domains ensures that all stakeholders understand how their work impacts the final product and ultimately the customer experience. By taking advantage of everything DevOps has taught us, product managers can create more efficient processes, smarter products, and happier customers.

It is also the rarest item in the game, with the lowest chance of dropping (or being chanced), which means it is also one of the most expensive. , on the other hand, “only” steals one Modifier from slain Rare monsters, and is far more common than a Headhunter. Click here to see a partial list of effects that can be stolen. Inspired Learning is different from Headhunter in two other ways: it is a Jewel instead of a Belt, and it requires four allocated notables inside of a small radius in order to activate. The build puts Inspired Learning at the Jewel Socket south of the starting position of the Duelist, and allocate , , and to activate it. Note that even though the stolen buffs stack, their duration is not reset for each Rare monster slain. This is why we are using ’s buff (Shaper’s Presence) to increase the stolen buff’s duration by 10%. It also negates Temporal Chain’s reservation cost when cast as an aura, which we use to curse ourselves (and everyone near us) via . Since we do not want our action speed to be reduced, we are using a high quality but level one . The final effect of Shaper’s Presence and the self curse would be 9% less action speed but 29% more stolen buff duration.

Why use Elemental Damage with Attacks when Brutality gives way more damage?\r\rSpeaking of Headhunter buffs, there are monster affixes that we can steal but do not benefit us. With , we cannot take advantage of Critical Strike/Multiplier affixes as well as those that generate Power Charges, since we do not crit.

Bestiary monsters are Rare monsters that we can steal buffs from. Delve: Kinda. We don’t have that much firepower to get into deep delving.

Again, Leap Slam would be better especially on maps with elevation changes. Harbinger: Yes. The Harbingers can create multiple Rare monsters. Abyss: Yes. Everytime the Abyss “crack” stops, it always spawns at least one rare. Legion: Kinda. Something that Chains would be better, but the Bleed pop helps. Blight: Kinda. Same as Legion above. Metamorph: Kinda. When the unique summons its rare mobs, the fight will suddenly become easier. Delirium: Kinda. The fog does not spawn many Rare monsters. Harvest: Yes. Focus on the big seeds to steal their buff, then clean up. Heist: Yes. After the alarm, Rare monsters spawn a lot. Ritual: Yes. Starting at the third Ritual, a lot of Rares are spawned. Expedition: Yes. Rare monsters spawned always have Ward, so burst those down first. How do you sustain mana when 98% of your mana is reserved? I don’t. All active skills are linked to . Why is this build named Eldertuin The Fortress? I randomly got an while gambling with Expedition League’s Gwennen. I was already looking for another build to make, having about 10 watchstones unlocked on the atlas, so I decided to check where I can use the mini headhunter jewel. When I saw that the socket near Duelist is easy to get, with access to an Endurance, Armor, Life and Bleed notables, I decided to make a Shield Crush + Shield Charge build. The name of the build came from the web serial The Wandering Inn, where there’s an adventurer named Eldertuin The Fortress who is known from using his shields. Also, this build uses a , which is very apt considering the events currently unfolding at Book 8. \rwindow.addEventListener('load', function() {\rwindow.HoradricHelper.PathOfExile.applyConfig({\rreference: \"Headhunter\",\riconUrl: \"https:\\/\\/web.poecdn.com\\/image\\/Art\\/2DItems\\/Belts\\/Headhunter.png\",\rdata:`\rItem Class: Belts\rRarity: Unique\rHeadhunter\rLeather Belt\r--------\rRequirements:\rLevel: 40\r--------\rItem Level: 80\r--------\r+40 to maximum Life (implicit)\r--------\r+63 to Strength\r+61 to Dexterity\r+50 to maximum Life\r27% increased Damage with Hits against Rare monsters\rWhen you Kill a Rare monster, you gain its Modifiers for 20 seconds\r--------\r\"A man's soul rules from a cavern of bone, learns and\rjudges through flesh-born windows.
