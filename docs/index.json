As a Product Owner, my work is anything but mundane, and every day holds a new set of puzzles to solve. But recently, there’s been a cloud hanging over my morning ritual that I’ve found increasingly difficult to ignore. It’s not an impending deadline or a problematic feature; it’s something much broader, with implications reaching far beyond my projects or even our organization. It’s the restrictions on the use of AI tools in the workplace that have become increasingly prevalent. My concern is not rooted in a resistance to change or an unhealthy attachment to the ways of the ‘good old days’, where we can use cutting edge AI without restriction. Rather, it’s based on the notion that these new rules on AI use, particularly with Large Language Models (LLMs), could inhibit innovation and growth in our rapidly advancing tech industry. These restrictions, while aimed at addressing valid concerns regarding privacy and proprietary data, have the potential to cause more harm than good, inadvertently stunting the creative and innovative capacities of our workforce. For those unfamiliar with the concept, LLMs are AI tools capable of performing a variety of tasks, both technical and non-technical. For us tech folks, these AI tools, like Github Copilot, have been a godsend, removing the necessity of boilerplate code, aiding in code review, and even helping to create context-specific unit tests. Non-technical workers, too, have found immense value in these tools, with applications ranging from automatic data analysis in Excel 365 to generating Minutes of Meetings in video chats. The recent regulations put in place against the use of these tools are undoubtedly grounded in concerns about data privacy and the proprietary nature of the work we do. But I believe there’s a way to navigate these issues without outright restricting access to these game-changing tools, a solution that lies in leveraging the services of AI tool providers who are already sharing data centers with us. Navigating the modern world of technology is a delicate balance. On one hand, we have the promise of innovation and efficiency that AI brings; on the other, there are legitimate concerns about data privacy and the proprietary nature of our work. This balancing act has led to the imposition of restrictions on AI tools in the workplace, a move that, in my opinion, carries unintended risks that might outweigh its benefits. The driving force behind these restrictions is the apprehension about proprietary data being shared with third-party companies who run the LLM models. While this fear is understandable, the solutions that have been proposed – to restrict the use of AI tools altogether – may be throwing the proverbial baby out with the bathwater. One immediate risk that springs to mind is the stifling of creativity and innovation. The tools that have become a part of our daily workflow do more than just automate tasks – they stimulate creative thinking and spur innovation by freeing up time and mental space. By imposing restrictions on their use, we are inadvertently hampering this creativity and curtailing the potential growth that comes with it. A second, perhaps less obvious, risk is the creation of a potential security loophole. With the restrictions in place, experts and engineers who have become accustomed to the convenience and efficiency of these tools may find ways to circumvent these rules. This could involve transferring code or other sensitive material to unmonitored, personal devices to take advantage of the AI tools, before transferring it back into the work environment. Not only does this introduce more risk to our proprietary products, it also puts a strain on our team members, who are now burdened with the task of manually doing work that was previously automated. The crux of the issue, and the irony of the situation, is that the effort to use another ","date":"2023-08-04","objectID":"/innovation-at-risk/:0:0","tags":["AI","Product Management","Work"],"title":"Rethinking Restrictions on AI Tools in the Workplace","uri":"/innovation-at-risk/"},{"categories":["Writing"],"content":"An immortal deity engages in a philosophical dialogue with a staunch non-believer named Sarai.

I am a deity, a spiritual being, as old as the primal energies that birthed the first stars, and I will remain, undying, even after the last stellar giants have exhausted their light and bowed to the inevitable darkness. But now, my focus converges on a soul entrenched in her own convictions—a non-believer named Sarai. Her existence hums distinctly in the grand tapestry of the universe, a discordant melody that disrupts my divine symphony, yet possesses an undeniable harmony of its own. Sarai—a woman of unyielding resilience, honed by the relentless grindstone of suffering and defiance. Her posture is as rigid as a century-old oak, her gaze as unyielding as hardened obsidian, all directed at me—an enigma she either refuses to understand or is unable to comprehend. She shields her soul within a fortress of disbelief, impervious to divine influence. She stands upon a vast plain, the verdant carpet of grass under her feet swaying like a sea stirred by an unseen force. Beyond her stretches the horizon, a thin line where earth and sky kiss, a testament to the world’s infinite mysteries. The azure canvas overhead is strewn with lazy cotton clouds that amble across the celestial dome, oblivious to the profound confrontation beneath them. Behind her, a solitary tree stands like a silent guardian, its gnarled branches whispering tales of the ages to the winds. “People make their own fate,” she says, the strength of her belief imbuing her words with a biting edge. She spits out the words like poison, each syllable a renunciation of the divine. “We don’t need gods to shape our lives.” I respond, not with thunderous might, but with the subtle rhythms of nature. I am the tremor beneath her feet, a subtle shiver of the earth that rattles her resolute stance. I am the wind’s sigh that toys with the loose strands of her hair, insinuating myself into her guarded space. I am the sun, its harsh but vital glare shining unobstructed onto her upturned face, daring her to deny my existence. “Sarai,” my voice, as timeless as the cosmos, reverberates within her mind. Each syllable echoes in sync with the pulsating rhythm of her heartbeat. “Do you truly believe your fate is yours alone to decide?” A silence descends between us—a profound stillness that stretches into infinity—as the beat of her heart falters momentarily. In this lapse, the seed of doubt sows itself. She remains silent, perhaps mulling over the audacity of my question, or maybe the shock of its resonance within her. For the first time, the fortress of her disbelief shudders. I dive deeper into Sarai’s consciousness, not as an intruder but as a guide, gently nudging her towards a revelation that extends beyond her firmly held beliefs. A divine resonance emanates from me, pulsing through her, vibrating in every particle of her being, rippling across the plain that stretches out around us. “Sarai, consider the world around you. You are a single pebble tossed into a vast lake. Your choices, your actions, they create ripples. Those ripples intersect with others, cascading outwards, far beyond your immediate sight. They echo into the world, the universe even, leaving impressions that last long after your own existence has faded.” She glances around, her dark eyes widening as if taking in the world for the first time. Her gaze roves from the gentle undulation of the grass, each blade dancing to the tune of the wind, to the solitary tree that stands tall, its branches a haven for the avian songsters who add their voices to the grand symphony of existence. Is it possible, in this moment, that she sees not just a plain but an orchestra of life, a concert of existence playing in harmonious coexistence?

We are the fortunate soothsayers at the forefront of a revolution, witnessing artificial intelligence’s gradual metamorphosis from sci-fi fantasy to reality. Yet, while we revel in the ongoing digital renaissance, it’s impossible to ignore the hurdles that come with it. Let’s embark on a brief journey through the current landscape of AI, focusing particularly on large language models (LLMs) and their workings. AI today is a buzzing beehive of innovation. Everywhere we look, we see LLMs proving their mettle. From composing human-like texts and predicting stock market trends to assisting in medical diagnoses, these intelligent systems are making their presence felt. LLMs learn from vast amounts of data, absorbing patterns, nuances, and knowledge, a process akin to an enthusiastic learner in a gigantic library, reading and internalizing as much as they can. LLMs operate on a simple principle. They’re trained on enormous datasets, extracting valuable information and making sense of it through what we call tokens. Picture tokens as snippets of information, like pieces of a puzzle that the model assembles to gain understanding and provide responses. To make the most of an LLM, one needs to feed it as many tokens as it can handle, pushing the boundaries of its capacity to ensure comprehensive learning. But here’s the snag. We’re constantly pushing the limits of the token count to equip the model with more knowledge, but doing so comes with its fair share of problems. There’s a cap on the number of tokens these models can process effectively, and exceeding this token limit can lead to inaccuracies and ‘hallucinations’ where the model begins to generate content that doesn’t align with reality. More crucially, the conventional approach to training AI models is time-consuming and resource-intensive. The training process requires us to feed proprietary data into the system, which is not only a mammoth task but also raises concerns around data privacy and security. So, are we resigned to these challenges, or is there a path that leads us towards a more efficient, accurate, and secure way of harnessing the power of LLMs? I believe there is, and it involves a fundamental shift in our approach, swapping the model training with a mechanism that allows AI to interact with databases directly. As we venture further, we’ll unpack this new approach, exploring its potential benefits and implications, and why I think it’s a game-changer in the realm of AI. To fully appreciate the transformative potential of the new approach I’m advocating for, it’s necessary to delve a little deeper into the issues faced with the conventional methods of training AI models. Our current approach to machine learning models hinges heavily on training. We teach models to learn and reason by exposing them to vast volumes of data, allowing them to understand patterns, context, and relationships. This training phase is crucial, determining the model’s eventual accuracy and its ability to handle complex tasks. However, the size of the training data and the time and computational power required for effective learning can make this process a formidable undertaking. Besides, the need to constantly update the training data to ensure the model remains relevant adds to the complexity. There’s also the question of the proprietary nature of data and the stringent need to adhere to data privacy norms. Then, we have the token limit problem, the invisible boundary that prevents us from stuffing our models with as much knowledge as we’d like. Each token a model processes eats into its total capacity, and exceeding this limit can lead to a degradation in the quality of the model’s responses. With these challenges at hand, what if we could pivot to a different strategy? One where we don’t have to worry about the token limit or go through the painstaking process of training the model on proprietary data?

This rings particularly true for my journey from a hands-on DotNet and DevOps engineer to Product Management, navigating the agile landscape with its emphasis on continuous integration, feedback loops, and quick iteration. The compass guiding me through this voyage has been a principle I’ve come to respect and cherish - Intellectual Humility. The transition from an engineer to product management brought with it a new perspective, a shift from hands-on problem-solving to strategic planning and team guidance. At first, my instinct was to lean on my technical knowledge, anticipating issues and guiding the team’s technical direction. However, I quickly recognized the potential and diversity each member of our team brought to the table. Their unique skills and ideas painted a broader, more vibrant picture. The cornerstone of Intellectual Humility, in my experience, is understanding that our knowledge has its limitations. It’s about being receptive to new insights and feedback, recognizing that it’s okay to not have all the answers. My role as a leader wasn’t to dictate solutions but to trust my team’s expertise, allowing them the freedom to innovate, explore, and bring their own insights to the forefront. Creating a culture of open dialogue and transparency has been an integral part of my journey in product management. Encouraging feedback from my team has not only broadened my perspective but also fostered a sense of mutual respect and collaboration. This practice wasn’t about minimizing my own skills or experiences, but about nurturing an environment that celebrates collective intelligence, where learning is a shared journey. Nevertheless, the principle of Intellectual Humility must walk hand in hand with a “trust but verify” approach. This balance became glaringly evident during a difficult incident. A misunderstanding led to some miscommunication about a feature that was believed to be blocked due to an external dependency. The reality, however, was that we were inadvertently causing the delay. This episode served as a gentle reminder that while trust is the foundation of any team, oversight is equally essential. Trusting in my team’s abilities or intentions did not have to mean complete abandonment of checks and verification. It was a lesson in understanding that accountability and trust are two sides of the same coin, mutually reinforcing to foster a transparent and reliable work environment. Applying Intellectual Humility, combined with the principle of “trust but verify”, has been a learning experience, shaping my approach to tackling challenges. I share these reflections not as an authority on the subject, but as a fellow traveler on the path of continuous growth and learning. Embracing Intellectual Humility and verifying as necessary isn’t about doubting your team’s capabilities. Instead, it is about nurturing a shared sense of accountability. For those navigating the ever-changing waters of Agile IT environments, I invite you to try this approach. Allow your team the space to surprise you with their skills and ideas, trust them, but also remember to verify. It’s not a sign of mistrust but a pillar of shared accountability that can lead us to learn, grow, and become more effective in our roles. In a technical context, Intellectual Humility manifests as an understanding that technology and its applications are ever-evolving landscapes. The solutions and techniques that were deemed best today might be overshadowed by more innovative, effective methodologies tomorrow. This acknowledgment has a direct influence on how we approach problem-solving. It encourages us to stay curious, open to new learning, and readily adaptable to emerging technologies and practices.

As a product owner, you’re the conductor of a complex symphony of ideas, resources, and time constraints, all revolving around one ultimate goal: delivering value to your end users. The key to achieving this lies not only in understanding what to deliver, but also in determining the order in which to deliver it. This is where the art and science of prioritization comes into play. Prioritization, in the context of agile development, is a critical practice that helps teams decide where to focus their limited resources to maximize the value delivered to the customer. This practice isn’t without its challenges. As product owners, we’re often faced with a deluge of features, bugs, enhancements, and technical debt, all competing for attention. The question that frequently arises is, “How do we choose what to work on first?” It’s a question that’s simple to ask, but complex to answer. There are a multitude of prioritization methods available—each with its unique approach and focus. From the Kano Model and Opportunity Scoring, which place a premium on user feedback, to the MoSCoW Model and Priority Poker, which emphasize stakeholder input, to methods like the Cost of Delay and Stack Ranking, which revolve around financial implications and feature comparison respectively. The key to effective prioritization lies in understanding these methods and knowing when to apply each one. Through the course of this article, I will delve into the nuances of these prioritization methods, focusing on the circumstances that might influence the choice of one over the other. My goal is to empower you, fellow product owners, with a deeper understanding of how to navigate these methods to deliver the most value to your customers and stakeholders. We’ve all been there. We have this goldmine of user feedback - a mix of praises, criticisms, and suggestions - and we’re stumped on how to use it to our advantage. When user feedback is crucial, a couple of methods stand out as particularly useful: the Kano Model and Opportunity Scoring. Let’s start with the Kano Model. It’s like a sorting hat for your feedback, neatly classifying them into must-haves, nice-to-haves, and delighters. These categories give you a clear understanding of what your users see as essential, what they see as bonuses, and what would truly impress them. It’s a great way to make sense of a flood of feedback and turn it into an actionable plan. The best part is, it gives you a visual representation of what needs to be prioritized. And who doesn’t love a good visual aid? It’s simple, it’s clear, and it’s a great way to get everyone on the same page about what matters most to your users. On the other hand, we have Opportunity Scoring. This method takes things a step further. It doesn’t just sort feedback; it anticipates it. It takes your user research data and, like a crystal ball, shows you what your users are likely to expect from your product. It’s a great way to get a step ahead of your users and shape your schedule to meet their expectations before they even voice them out. It ensures you’re investing your resources wisely, focusing on what your users will find valuable rather than what might just be a waste of time. So, when user feedback is crucial to your decision-making process, remember the Kano Model and Opportunity Scoring. One helps you sort and prioritize feedback, and the other helps you anticipate and meet user expectations. Both will ensure your product development is driven by what your users really want and need. There are times when the decision-making power rests predominantly within the organization. It’s when the stakeholders in your company have the final say. In this scenario, the methods that come to the fore are Priority Poker, the $100 Test, and the MoSCoW Model. Priority Poker is reminiscent of a high-stakes poker game where the right decision can lead to a huge payof","date":"2023-06-10","objectID":"/the-art-of-prioritization/:0:0","tags":["Agile","Product Management","Work"],"title":"Agile Methods Every Product Owner Should Know","uri":"/the-art-of-prioritization/"},{"categories":["Work"],"content":"Excited to share my thoughts on an intriguing approach to stakeholder management in agile environments.

This wisdom comes not just from personal experience, but also from a very enlightening stakeholder management training I undertook. In an agile environment, change is the only constant. Priorities shift, requirements evolve, and teams adapt accordingly. Amid this flux, stakeholders play a pivotal role. They not only bring in resources and expertise but also guide the product’s direction through their unique insights and feedback. Therefore, effective stakeholder management is key to navigating these ever-shifting sands. Product owners, in particular, juggle a variety of responsibilities, one of which is the regular communication with diverse stakeholders. Each of these individuals or groups has their own interests, concerns, and expectations regarding the product. Understanding and managing these different needs and perspectives is critical for the smooth execution of the project. With the right stakeholder management skills, product owners can foster more open communication, drive consensus more efficiently, and respond to changes more effectively. These skills also help mitigate potential conflicts, facilitate better decision-making, and ultimately, lead to a more successful product. Each stakeholder brings unique perspectives, strengths, and challenges to a project. In my training, I learned the importance of recognizing these differences - much like a zookeeper understands the unique needs and behaviors of various animals in their care. Just as a zookeeper interacts differently with a panther, peacock, dolphin, or owl, a product owner must tailor their communication and management strategies to suit each stakeholder. This is the “animal profiles” approach. It enhances communication, reduces conflict, and improves project outcomes. Drawing from my training and experience, I want to delve into these animal profiles, explore real-world scenarios, and propose effective engagement strategies for each stakeholder type. One useful approach I learned during my stakeholder management training is categorizing stakeholders into four distinct profiles, akin to different animal species: Panthers, Peacocks, Dolphins, and Owls. Each of these ‘animal profiles’ represents a different set of behaviors, tendencies, and communication styles. Panthers are aggressive and fast-moving. They are often competitive, making others tense but driving progress rapidly. Peacocks are social, colorful, and creative. They can be dramatic and enjoy being the center of attention, often bringing a spark of energy and innovation. Dolphins are friendly and empathetic, often serving as peacemakers. They are team players, fostering unity and collaboration. Owls are detail-focused, clear, and logical. They are patient and wise, preferring to take their time to ensure precision and accuracy. Remember, these are just guidelines. Stakeholders may not neatly fit into one category, or they may exhibit traits from multiple profiles. Additionally, a stakeholder’s profile can change over time, depending on various factors like the context of the project, their personal circumstances, and more.

In such a case, you can present the available data, discuss the potential consequences of delay, and propose a plan to adjust the course if necessary once more data is available. This approach satisfies their need for detailed analysis, while also maintaining the project’s momentum. Effective stakeholder management is like tending to a diverse ecosystem. Each stakeholder, akin to a unique species, has their own characteristics and needs. As product owners in an agile environment, our role is not only to understand these differences but also to adapt our communication and management strategies accordingly. Through the “animal profiles” approach - Panthers, Peacocks, Dolphins, and Owls - we can gain valuable insights into stakeholders' behavior and tendencies. This allows us to engage with them more effectively, leading to better communication, less conflict, and improved project outcomes. It’s important to remember, however, that these profiles are not rigid categories, but rather flexible guidelines. People are complex and can exhibit characteristics from multiple profiles or change over time. Moreover, the goal is not to label stakeholders but to better understand their perspectives and create a productive work environment. Our focus should be on fostering mutual respect, open communication, and collaboration in our diverse stakeholder ecosystem. Ultimately, effective stakeholder management is about nurturing relationships and steering your team towards shared goals. And while it may be challenging, it’s certainly a rewarding journey, leading us to successful products that truly meet our users' needs. Note: This was first published as a LinkedIn article.

One day, I’m watching a cat video, and the next, I’m getting a philosophy lesson from John Searle about his Chinese Room Argument. Now, I don’t work with AI or anything, but as someone involved in tech, it got me thinking – have we moved past this Chinese Room thing with the latest AI advancements? It’s an intriguing question and well, here I am, exploring this curiosity and writing about it. Who knew a TikTok video could lead to such a deep dive, right? The philosophical underpinnings of artificial intelligence (AI) have long been a subject of profound debate. One argument, presented by philosopher John Searle, has managed to encapsulate a particular line of inquiry regarding AI’s ability (or inability) to comprehend. Known as the Chinese Room argument, this thought experiment has influenced AI theory since its inception. In 1980, Searle posed a hypothesis challenging the premise that machines can possess ‘understanding’ in the same sense as human beings do. His Chinese Room scenario paints a vivid picture: imagine a non-Chinese speaking person situated in a room. This individual is provided with an elaborate set of instructions, a “rule book” of sorts, which allows them to translate incoming Chinese characters into outgoing characters. To anyone outside the room, it would appear as if the operator inside truly comprehends Chinese, as they process and produce sensible Chinese phrases. However, in truth, the operator does not understand the language. They are merely following the rules set out before them, translating symbols according to an established guide without comprehension of the language’s meaning or syntax. Searle proposed this scenario as an analog to AI, suggesting that AI, much like the individual in the Chinese Room, may mimic human-like responses without possessing an iota of genuine understanding. Searle’s Chinese Room argument fundamentally challenges the concept of Strong AI, or the belief that machines can genuinely understand and exhibit human-like intelligence. The argument has been considered an intellectual bulwark against the notion of truly cognitive machines, asserting that while machines may simulate understanding, this is an illusion. They are, according to Searle, devoid of consciousness, mind, and understanding, trapped eternally within their Chinese Room. The AI landscape has undergone seismic shifts since John Searle first introduced the Chinese Room Argument. Among the most significant advancements in AI theory and practice is the emergence of Large Language Models (LLM), such as OpenAI’s GPT-3 \u0026 GPT-4, Google’s Bard (LaMDA, PaLM), and Meta’s LLaMA. These advanced AI systems have brought forth new ways of understanding how machines can learn, adapt, and even potentially understand, challenging long-standing assumptions. In the earlier days of AI, machines were rule-based, operating within predefined parameters. They were confined to following specific instructions, much like the operator in Searle’s Chinese Room. However, the advent of LLMs marked a notable departure from these traditional rule-based systems. Powered by complex neural networks, these models mimic the human brain’s learning processes in ways never before seen in AI. These AI models are trained on vast databases of human language, encompassing a broad spectrum of topics, contexts, and nuances. Through deep learning, they are capable of recognizing patterns, discerning relationships, and making predictions based on the data they’ve been trained on. Their operation extends beyond mere rule-following; they demonstrate a form of learning akin to human cognitive processes. Furthermore, these LLM-based AIs have made some remarkable strides, demonstrating capabilities that edge closer to a human-like understanding of information. In 2020, OpenAI’s GPT-3 generated human-like text, seemingly understanding and producing language beyond simple rule-following.

Do you agree with my choices? What would you add to this list?","date":"2023-05-15","objectID":"/beyond-abcs/","tags":["Non-fiction","Family","Alisaie"],"title":"Preparing my daughter for a STEM Future","uri":"/beyond-abcs/"},{"categories":["Writing"],"content":"As a parent, envisioning the future of my child is a task filled with dreams, aspirations, and a bit of anxiety. My daughter, currently a lively toddler of 27 months, is at the beginning of her lifelong journey of learning. I often find myself contemplating the skills and values I’d like to instill in her, especially as she prepares to step into the educational arena in a couple of years. From personal experiences and reflections, I’ve identified three critical areas that I believe will shape her into a strong, independent thinker, capable of carving her path in any STEM field - a sector I hope she’ll find her passion in. These aren’t just academic skills; they’re life skills. They’re about understanding, questioning, communicating, and creating. Over the course of this article, I’ll be delving into each of these areas: learning to be a ‘Good Student’, the art of effective note-taking, and the pivotal role of mathematics. I invite you to join me on this exploration, whether you’re a parent, educator, or just someone interested in the lifelong journey of learning. In a world where information comes at us from every direction, it’s crucial to foster a discerning mindset from an early age. This is the first and perhaps the most crucial lesson I want to impart to my daughter: how to be a ‘Good Student’. This term goes beyond conventional definitions - it’s not just about acing exams or pleasing teachers. Instead, it’s about creating a balance between understanding the curriculum and retaining her individuality and personal beliefs. One of the most challenging aspects of learning, especially in a traditional classroom setting, is distinguishing between what is being taught and what she believes. Just because an authority figure, like a teacher, imparts a piece of information, it doesn’t automatically make it an absolute truth. However, being a ‘Good Student’ in this context requires a delicate dance. She should be able to demonstrate understanding of the material, to satisfy the teacher’s expectations, without letting it override her personal belief system. Let’s take an example. Suppose she’s in a history class, learning about a controversial event. The teacher, influenced by their background, may present a version of the event that leans towards a particular viewpoint. As a ‘Good Student’, my daughter should acknowledge this perspective, take it into account, but also understand that there might be other perspectives out there. She might need to agree in class, to meet the educational expectations, but she should also be motivated to explore other perspectives independently. In essence, my daughter should be acutely aware when she is embodying the role of a ‘Good Student’. This means reiterating what the teacher believes or wants her to believe without letting it affect her own perspective. It’s a skill that not only applies to her future classroom but in many aspects of life where she’ll need to navigate differing viewpoints. This capacity to discern, question, and remain open-minded will be the cornerstone of her intellectual growth. It will help her form her unique perspectives, build her resilience in the face of differing opinions, and enhance her ability to communicate her ideas effectively. It’s not about breeding dissent, but fostering a mindset that values curiosity and critical thinking. In the digital age, where we have almost unlimited access to information, knowing how to organize, retain, and recall that information becomes a vital skill. This brings me to the second lesson I wish to impart to my daughter - the art of effective note-taking. At first glance, note-taking might seem like a mundane task, but its importance cannot be overstated. It’s not just about jotting down what is being said or discussed. Rather, it’s an active process of making sense of the information, synthesizing it, and creating a personalized knowledge database that she can return to and build upon. Note-taking begins in the classroom.

First and foremost, I am also a member of the Millennial generation. Specifically, I’m an “elder millennial,” to borrow a phrase from Iliza Shlesinger. This is not an attempt to start a fight or stir up controversy; rather, it is a personal account of a problem I faced and how I overcame it. When I was still a software engineer, I encountered numerous bugs, issues, and impediments. When I inevitably run into one, I have learned from my more experienced coworkers to find an expert right away who can help me solve the problem at hand. Alternatively, if I am unable to identify an expert in a specific area, I have also learned that reaching out to my Product Owner is very beneficial. POs are well-connected with stakeholders who possess the necessary skills and knowledge to help me overcome obstacles. By closely working with POs, I can leverage their network and identify the appropriate person who can offer me the necessary guidance and expertise. Now that I’m the Product Owner in charge of a team of engineers' backlog, I’ve noticed a few things. First, all of my engineers are younger millennials, and second, the issues that they are dealing with are a lot more complex than what I had encountered before. I thought it was just an experience or training gap, but as we worked together more, I saw that I was lucky to have brilliant engineers on my team. However, when they bring up issues during our stand ups and retrospectives, it’s always a lot more complicated than what I was expecting. During one of our meetings, I finally realized what the difference was when one of our engineers explained an issue to me. After they told me what was going on, but before I was able to get a word in to clarify something, the engineer started listing the solutions that they had tried to solve the problem. Each of these solutions had specific drawbacks and a well-considered explanation for why it wouldn’t solve our initial problem. I expected them to try to solve problems before requesting assistance, but not like this. Looking back at our previous impediments, it appears that almost always, a younger millennial will opt to try each solution out and explore the problem space before asking for help. It seems as though they would always opt to prepare beforehand because they expect to be questioned about why they did not do this or that before reaching out for support. At first, this may sound good. Why wouldn’t an engineer try to figure things out before seeking assistance? However, the end result is typically a worker who never asks for help. In the rare cases when they do ask for support, their question is incredibly nuanced and difficult to solve. Even in the cases where they didn’t ask for help, they may have spent more time and effort exploring the problem space than simply sending a message to a domain expert. This situation can cause a lot of frustration and confusion in the workplace as the engineer spends hours trying to figure out a problem that could have been solved in a few minutes by simply asking someone else. When I realized the difference between my working style and that of my younger colleagues, I confided with a mentor and asked if they had seen this behavior before. We learned that colleagues from the generation before us, or those who worked primarily with the last generation, have encountered similar issues with the upcoming millennial generation. We kept talking about this problem, and when we brought in more coworkers and some younger engineers, we came up with a solution. We should look at a problem (bug, issue, impediment, etc.) as if it were a tree, and its solutions would be its stems and leaves. Younger millennials tend to look at the whole tree, going through the “stems” or solutions that they can see. When they finally ask for help, they will list the problems they have run into whil","date":"2023-02-28","objectID":"/generational-shift-in-solving-issues/:0:0","tags":["Product Management","Work","Millenial"],"title":"A Generational Shift in Solving Issues","uri":"/generational-shift-in-solving-issues/"},{"categories":["Work"],"content":"The issue for DevOps and Product Management is the same: How can we create the smallest possible change with the greatest potential impact?","date":"2023-01-24","objectID":"/devops-and-product-mgmt/","tags":["DevOps","Product Management","Work"],"title":"What I Learned From DevOps, Applied to Product Management","uri":"/devops-and-product-mgmt/"},{"categories":["Work"],"content":"It has been several enlightening months since I transitioned from a DevOps Engineering role to being a Product Owner. I have learned a lot from my colleagues who have been in the role for years, but there are also certain aspects that have been unique to my experience, such as the use of agile principles and applying DevOps principles to product management. As the owner of a product, most of the value you provide comes from pushing the features of your product forward. This requires understanding what the customer wants, how the product needs to be built and deployed, and ensuring that there is a plan to deliver on time. This is where I first noticed the overlap between the principles of DevOps and those of product management. At the heart of both disciplines is the idea that small changes can have a big impact on the success of an organization or product. The issue for both is the same: How can we create the smallest possible change with the greatest potential impact? By applying DevOps-style continuous integration (CI) during product development, product managers are able to identify areas for improvement faster and more accurately, as well as quickly deploy changes with minimal disruption. One of the ways that this can be done is by dramatically reducing the size of features before implementation. Teams can then test various iterations quickly and effectively before moving forward. Additionally, DevOps' continuous feedback loops make sure that problems are found and fixed right away. The same principle applies to product management: understanding user needs through feedback loops and weekly catchup meetings helps us make better decisions about what we’re building and how we’re building it. Inter-team collaboration is another area that DevOps (and being Agile in general) emphasize. Product managers should take this same approach in order to realize their product vision. Working with everyone from different domains ensures that all stakeholders understand how their work impacts the final product and ultimately the customer experience. By taking advantage of everything DevOps has taught us, product managers can create more efficient processes, smarter products, and happier customers.

Impale stores 10% of the initial hit’s Physical damage, and deals the recorded damage to the target each time it is hit again.
