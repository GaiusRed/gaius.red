Impale stores 10% of the initial hit’s Physical damage, and deals the recorded damage to the target each time it is hit again. It remains until the maximum of 5 impale stacks is reached, which we are able to apply in one second. This is why we are aiming for at least 6 attacks per second.

It has the extremely powerful mod When you kill a Rare monster, you gain its Modifiers for 20 seconds, especially since every Rare monster would have at least three modifiers.

I was already looking for another build to make, having about 10 watchstones unlocked on the atlas, so I decided to check where I can use the mini headhunter jewel. When I saw that the socket near Duelist is easy to get, with access to an Endurance, Armor, Life and Bleed notables, I decided to make a Shield Crush + Shield Charge build.
